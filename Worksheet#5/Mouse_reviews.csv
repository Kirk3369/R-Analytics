Turns itself off to save battery, starts up and reconnects quickly from sleep. Amazing that you can spend 2 or 3 times the money and get basically the same mouse.",5,NA
"2","Mouse","TeckNet Portable Wireless Mouse","Anonymous","Reviewed in the United States on June 29, 2015","","Using it right now. I'm a very clumsy person and have already dropped it a few dozen times and it still works just fine. The battery life is good. Could be better. The feature that turns the mouse off after being idle for so long does help with that I assume. I am still one to turn it off when I'm done using it. The On/Off button on the bottom is great. The last mouse I had it got worn out and I had to use a pen or something to flip it, I can tell just by looking at it that this one will not have that problem. I have had it for about... I want to say about 5 months and I've replaced the battery twice.This mouse is a 5 button mouse. The 6th below the scroll wheel is only to adjust the pointer speed. You can't remap it to anything else. The count of 5 also includes the scroll wheel.Speaking of the scroll wheel lets talk about it. It is easy to use, though it is a bit stiffer than some other mice I have used. It is textured, and so far has shown no ware. As stated before I have dropped it several times already and it still works perfectly. It has about a 8 ft range that I have found so far, and at that range it is already pretty spotty. The usb connector is slightly larger than other's I have seen, but it is also textured so it is easy to get a grip on it as well. The two buttons on the side work flawlessly. They could be on the mouse further up, as I end up having to use the knuckle of my thumb to hit the closest one, but I suppose I got used to the design. It was weird at first, but now it just seems right. There is a very grippy texture on the sides of the mouse that make up for the weird design. They help you hold and keep a hold of the mouse.  The 6th above mentioned button also has an LED light in it. There are three settings, I always use the third and fastest for my games =PThe left and right click are nice. The mouse itself has a good feel to it and good pressure on the main two buttons. The button on the scroll wheel is a bit harder to press down than most mice, but nothing too bad. There is also a convenient little hole by the battery under the cover where you can put the USB dongle if you are traveling.This mouse is very durable... And I mean that. I have dropped it, or it has slid off of the arm of my couch onto my hard wood floor, several times now. A few times the buttons seemed to be stuck, but all I had to do was pop them back into place. My other mouse that I dropped about the same amount of times so far, can no longer left click. After using this mouse for so long I have cleaned it a few times. The slick texture holds oil and dead skin from your hand easily, and can get dirty very quick.10/10 Absolutely fantastic mouse for the price. I am a satisfied customer and have used this mouse constantly since I got it. I would highly recommend this mouse to anyone who has been looking for a durable 5 button mouse.",5,NA
"3","Mouse","TeckNet Portable Wireless Mouse","Souvik","Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2016","Cheap and works well","Used it just for a day continuously and I am very satisfied with it. Although I was skeptical initially because of the brand in comparison to Microsoft, HP and Logitech, but I chose the TeckNet wireless mouse due to the long battery life claim, the curved left side for the thumb which is very ergonomic and the price.I took a chance with ordering it online, but it turned out to be a good buy. The mouse is very comfortable and works well. Comfortable size, convenient mouse buttons on the left side, quick and responsive, adjustable speeds. Also, when not in use for a certain amount of time the mouse will turn off. All it takes is one click and it comes right back on.Its scroll wheel doesn't natively support Hyper Scroll nor horizontal scrolling but, if you click the scroll wheel, it will enter a kind of ""Pan Mode"" and you can just move your mouse up/down as well as horizontally to scroll/pan the page quickly. Actually, I found that by pressing down the scroll wheel rather than just clicking it offered better control, and of course I don't have to click it again to toggle it out of ""Pan Mode""! I think this quick scrolling works in Chrome by default, but in Firefox you might have to enable ""Smooth Scrolling"" and/or ""Autoscrolling"" before it will work; it also works in certain programs such as Microsoft Office 2010.This mouse offers 3 DPI settings, which basically changes how quickly the cursor moves across your screen. I found one that I liked and am very happy with the options. Back/Forward buttons on the side are a nice touch as well, although I forget to use them most of the time.The intelligent power saving option is a great thing, where it knows when to switch itself off (or rather go into hibernation) to conserve battery. Usually when you have not been using it for a few minutes it will hibernate - even when your screen might still be on! Once it's in hibernation you'll have to click a button to turn it on again; so far it has been quite responsive, and I never had to ""wait"" for it to come out of hibernation after clicking. Unfortunately you can't set how long before it goes into hibernation, but I am satisfied with its default fixed setting. This feature has grown on me because that means my computer won't accidentally exit its sleep state whenever I touch the mouse! Now I can just move my mouse around to make room for printed documents or whatever, and only wake up the computer intentionally by clicking one of the mouse buttons!All in all, the Tecknet M002 is a great competition for the high priced mice from bigger brands available in market. I wish it had more customization options but - considering it's less than 1/3 the price of them and available in 5 different colours - it's worthy of 5 stars for me.After using it only for a short time, I am very happy with this product. Hard to beat at this price as well.",5,NA

"11","Mouse","TeckNet Portable Wireless Mouse","mathias mirra","Reviewed in France on January 25, 2023","","Spiele werden moderner, PCs werden moderner, Software ändert sich ständig und das hat die Auswirkung, daß die Maussensibilität meiner aktuell 11 Jahren Funkmaus mit Tastatur, trotz maximal eingestellter Maussensibilität in einem und manch anderen modernen Spiele nicht mehr ausreicht um zügig und gut spielen zu können.Darum mußte eine neue Maus her. Und zwar eine Funk-Maus. Kabelsalat habe ich zu genüge.Habe mich für diese Maus entschieden, weil sie im Angebot war und einen guten Eindrcuk machte was Funktionen und sowieso DPI-EInstellmöglichkeiten laut Artikelbeschreibung betrifft.Maus wurde zum besagten Liefertermin geliefert. Eine stabile dicke Papiertüte und darin eine qualitative gute Pappschachtel mit Maus. MAus ist in extra Luftpolsterfolie eingepackt um wirklich sicher zu gehen das beim Transport nichts passieren kann.Maus getestet und bin begeistert. Batterien rein, USB-Funkstecker am PC eingesteckt und sofort betriebsbereit. Keine Treiberinstalation nötig.Funktioniert tadellos und moderne Spiele spielen macht nun wirklich Sinn mit der stark verbesserten Maussensibilität. Liegt sehr gut in der Hand. fühlt sich qualitativ sehr hochwertig an.DPI läßt sich problmlos über einen Knopf in 6 Stufen einstellen und wird mit LED-blinken angezeigt welche Stufe man aktuell eingestellt hat. 1x blinken = Stufe 1 langsamste DPI, 6x blinken = Stufe 6 schnellste DPI.Wird der PC ausgemacht oder in Standbymodus versetzt, ist die Maus auch sofort im Ruhemodus versetzt um Batterien zu sparen und will man den PC anmachen, einfach an der Maus eine Taste klicken, dann wird PC und Maus wieder aktiviert.Wird direkt am PC eingeschaltet, muß man die Maus seperat aus dem Ruhemodus mit Tastendruck holen. Vorraussetzung ist, das der Schiebehauptschalter immer auf AN ist.Benutzt man die Maus eine geraume zeitlang nicht, schaltet sie sich selbst in den Ruhemodus. Dann einfach eine Taste an der Maus drücken und weiter geht es.Die Tasten sind angenehm zu bedienen und sehr leise. Ich höre zum Glück sehr gut, aber die Maus ist die leiseste von den Klickgeräusche wo ich bisher hatte. Schalter selbst fühlen sich stabil udn haltbar an.Mausrad ist auch präzie mit Stufen zu bedienen. Nicht zu leichtgängig, auch nicht zu schwer und die Rasterstufen sind auch gut vom Abstand her gemacht. Mausrad selbst fühlt sich ebenso stabil udn haltbar an gegenüber den Gummiringen behafteten Plastikrädern wo bei meiner alten Maus schon ewig kaputt ist und mit grauen gutklebenden Klebeband improvisiert habe.Mir gefällt die Maus, macht das was ich für ausreichend schnelle Bewegungen in Spiele, mit Luft nach oben (Stufe 3 für ein Spiel eingestellt) brauche und ist sehr präzise und Reaktionsschnell.Von meiner Seite eine Kaufempfehlung.",5,NA

"14","Mouse","EVGA Customizable Ambidextrous Mouse","Preston's Automotive","Reviewed in the United States on June 7, 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","I've long been a fan of Logitech game mice because of their initial fit/finish and reliability.  I momentarily went with corsair gaming mice and after 2 bad experiences, including one going completely DOA after a firmware update,  went back to Logitech.  I've never had a logitech mouse go DOA on me.  However,  over time.  I find that the soft-touch and rubberized coatings on their mice eventually become sticky.  Or even wearing off completely.  Mind you every logitech mouse still works.  It's just no longer pleasant to handle with the worn spots straight down to the plastic.  Even after wiping them down and washing my hands.  It feels like it's crusted over with many layers of red-hot cheetos dust.I've been a fan recently of EVGA's Z10 gaming keyboards with the Cherry brown switches.  So i decided to give the X12 mouse (white) a try.  The price was right at $19.99 on sale.  The mouse itself is light and absent of any kind of soft touch or rubberized coating.  Which likely means you won't run into the wear and tear issues associated with higher end mice with the ""nice when new"" coatings and surfaces.  The plastic itself reminds of of the textured white plastic used on the legendary Microsoft laser Intellimouse revered by old school FPS gamers.  The button clicks are crisp and precise.  The tracking is spot on.  The unleashed RBG software is easy to use and allows control over the RGB lighting over 3 separate zones with a handful of effects with various colors.  If you don't care for gimmicky effects,  you could always set it to static with any color of choice,  or turn it off completely.So far so good.  Time will tell how the X12 will wear.  But given first impressions and the cheap price.  I may consider picking up another X12 (white) to put into cold storage incase this mouse ends up being the GOAT.  Naturally i'll update this review (good or bad) as I continue to use this mouse.Update: A year later the scroll wheel starting acting up and jumping when scrolling in a web browser on sites like Amazon and Facebook.  Scrolling down very slowly will cause the page to scroll up instead.  To rule out it wasn't anything else,  I plugged my crusty old Logitech G402 mouse into the same USB port on the PC and kept the windows mouse settings the same and the annoyance completely vanished.  Scrolling became predictable and precise again.  Obviously an issue with the sensor tracking the movement of the scroll wheel.  I'll take this mouse to my workshop to blast it with some compressed air,  but at this point,  it doesn't look good in regards to longevity for this mouse if that doesn't resolve the issue.  Luckily I only paid $20 for it.",5,NA
"15","Mouse","EVGA Customizable Ambidextrous Mouse","Michael S.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024","","I bought this mouse for my work because I'm at my desk most of the day and wanted a gaming mouse for the ergonomics and extra functions. I have a gaming mouse at home and love the feel. This mouse is super comfortable and functional! I saw in the reviews that the scroll wheel was flimsy. I say it has a little give, but that's because you can move it side to side to to scroll to the side, which I like. For the price, I like it! Let's see how long it holds up!",5,NA
"16","Mouse","EVGA Customizable Ambidextrous Mouse","Jv","Reviewed in the United States on July 11, 2023","Good mouse for ""claw"" style grippers.","I love almost everything about this mouse—the weight, the ergonomics, the DPI switches, even the sniper button (I don't play competitively so it's not a big deal to me, and besides, you can remap it).The MASSIVE con is that the scroll wheel will very likely break with heavy use. My first one busted after like four-five months; the second has lasted about 15 months, but just broke today.EVGA very likely knows about this flaw, and it's all over in their own forums, on Amazon reviews, Reddit, wherever. The wheel's axle is apparently super tiny and can't handle extended wear and tear for heavy users.By how many years this has been a problem, I wonder if it's somehow cheaper for them to just replace the mouse whenever someone files an RMA than to fix the design.Much less egregious of a con is that the rubber on the scroll wheel will probably start sliding over the wheel's plastic after not too long. I've needed to glue it in place for both, but that solved the problem both times and I've not had to think about it since.Sooooo brand loyalty? Get something else? That's up to you, but I don't like what at this point feels kind of like willful neglect by EVGA which otherwise makes pretty good products.",4,NA

Super comfortable, stylish, and useful for my FPS gaming needs! The software is easy to download and use, and doesn't take up tons of processing power (unlike my old mouse Razer software) and has tons of customizable features for DPS, Buttons, Clutch button DPS, RGB Pattern, profiles and more! The adjustable weight is a really nice feature too, and the response time is insane! The only issue I had with it is that the polling rate by default was super high (8000 Hz) and the mouse seemed to be ""lagging"" on games, but it is easy to change in the settings (most games I play are older and max at 1000 Hz). Also, make sure to use USB 3.0 or Super Speed ports. Otherwise, this is probably the best budget mouse I got! I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a budget mouse!",5,NA

"26","Mouse","Logitech Wireless Mouse M185","Butterflywings09","Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2023","Works Great!","I ordered this mouse (in blue) to replace the recently deceased exact same model that I've used for the past 2 or 3 years.  I like the simplicity of the M185 mouse and mostly the best bang for your buck!  I caught this one on sale for less than a ten-spot, so I thought, ""why not.""  I'm hoping that this one will last a bit longer than my two previous M185 models, that averaged about 3 years each.  This model seems plagued by a short life span and is predisposed to mysteriously and suddenly dying, without any obvious symptoms or warning of any kind - - you're working and clicking along, going about your day, when suddenly the cursor on the computer screen freezes and that's it.  Nothing, zero, nada.  Funny thing, I'm very careful not to abuse or drop the mouse, and keep a fresh battery installed and watch for leakage and all that stuff - - they just stop working, and I assume it is caused by some sort of inherent electronic fault in the circuitry of the previous M185's.  Due to my loyalty to the brand and model (and since it was on sale) I decided to give it one more shot. They say that ""third time's a charm"".  I like the fact that the M185 is simple and uncluttered with extra buttons that I would never use for my purpose, which is simple web-browsing and the occasional text document production.  The feel is solid, not heavy, but not cheap feeling, either.  I'm used to the shape of this mouse, which to me is quite comfortable for long sessions, another reason why I kind of wanted to stay with this model. The buttons have an audible ""click"", which doesn't bother me at all, and the wheel moves smoothly and also has a clicking operation (which I rarely ever use).  The overall surface of the mouse has a matte finish, but like my previous models I'm sure it will eventually wear shiny spots where my fingers reside and will attain a more ""well-used"" look in time.  Connecting it was a breeze, too.  I just plugged the dongle into a spare rear usb port of my desktop, and the mouse connected instantly, no problem.  The dongle can be stored safely inside the battery compartment, so you can take the whole thing out of the house if needed for use elsewhere.  The speed of 1000 dpi seems just right for my purposes.  The one I ordered even came with its own AA Duracell battery, which I wasn't really expecting.  This mouse also enters ""sleep mode"" when you don't use it for a while, and I can't say how many times I've got up and left it on all night.  And that's not hard to do, as I'll explain next.  The only real negative to this mouse is the absence of any easily visible status indicator of it's on / off switch.  The rear housing of this mouse is matte black, including the tiny switch where you turn it on and off with your fingernail, with only a very faint ""on"" lettering (also black), and very hard to see with my aging eyes.  The laser is not lighted or visible when on, also adding to the confusion, especially in a darkened room.  So, as a workaround, I took a tiny drop of green paint and placed it down inside the switch slider to visibly help indicate the ""on"" position, and likewise a dot of bright orange for the ""off"" position.  Many of Logitech's more expensive models (and a few other manufacturers) include this color-coded switch indication. I guess for the $$, they had to cut corners somewhere - - a minor complaint.  In summary, this is a good basic mouse that works - - let's hope that this one will last longer than its two predecessors.",5,NA

Needless to say my husband was not used to hearing so many clicks and the noise was on his last nerve. I looked for a quieter mouse and came across this one. I have been a fan of Logitech mice for quite some time so I figured this would be a good product. Logitech did not let me down! I opened the box immediately to see just how quiet it really was and to my surprise it actually is SILENT!! It does connect to my laptop instantly as soon as I push the button on the bottom that  puts it in discovery mode. It works just as smoothly as any of my other Logitech mice (not that I was expecting it to function any differently). I do wish that it came in more fun colors and patterns like the M325 for instance (like the ones you find at Best Buy, Walmart, Office Depot etc.)There were a couple of downsides that I noticed (personal downsides, may not be an issue to everyone else). One of which is that even though it is a bluetooth mouse I would have liked to have the USB receiver, again not that big of a deal unless you don't have a bluetooth computer. Another thing I noticed is that there is a sharp edge all the way around the mouse. My pinky finger hangs over the side of the mouse and rubs against the seam, and I started to realize that my finger was starting to hurt. Unsure why I looked at the mouse and didn't see anything that would be obvious, however when I ran my finger around that seam I noticed that it was rather sharp. I asked my husband if he knew how I could fix it and he suggested sanding it down a little. I ran my nail around the edge on that side to see if I could knock some of the sharpness down and it seemed to work, holding it is more comfortable now.PROS:its SILENT!!!!easy to set uptracking is smoothCONS:did not come with USB recieversharp edge around entire mouse (seam)limited color options",4,NA

"41","Mouse","Logitech LIGHTSPEED Wireless Gaming Mouse","PandoRides","Reviewed in the United States on July 12, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","I recently purchased the Logitech G305 LIGHTSPEED Wireless Gaming Mouse, and I have to say, it’s been a game-changer for me. As someone who games regularly, I was looking for a mouse that could deliver on performance without the hassle of wires, and the G305 does just that. I used to own one beforehand and lost it during a move sadly..First off, the wireless performance is outstanding. I haven’t noticed any lag whatsoever, which is crucial when you’re in the middle of intense gameplay. It’s really liberating to have that kind of responsiveness without being tethered to my desk.The design is another big plus. It fits my hand perfectly and feels comfortable even during long gaming sessions. The mouse is lightweight but feels solidly built, so it moves smoothly and doesn’t tire out my hand.The sensor is super accurate too. I play a lot of FPS games, and the HERO sensor handles everything I throw at it with precision. Customizing the DPI settings was easy using Logitech's software, and I’ve set it up exactly how I like it.Overall, the G305 offers amazing value for money. Considering its performance, build quality, and the freedom of wireless, I’d highly recommend it to any gamer looking to upgrade their setup. It’s definitely one of the best gaming mice I’ve owned.",5,NA
"42","Mouse","Logitech LIGHTSPEED Wireless Gaming Mouse","Mikel","Reviewed in the United States on November 22, 2024","","Wireless Performance: The Lightspeed wireless technology is fantastic. I’ve experienced zero lag or missed clicks during intense gaming sessions, and the 1ms response time feels just as good as a wired mouse.HERO Sensor: The 12,000 DPI HERO sensor is precise and responsive, making it perfect for FPS games like Valorant or Call of Duty. It tracks smoothly on most surfaces (though not glass) and offers excellent accuracy.Battery Life: The battery life is exceptional. With a single AA battery, I’ve gotten close to the advertised 250 hours of use. If you switch to a lithium battery, you can even reduce the mouse’s weight slightly while maintaining long-lasting performance.Compact Design: The small, lightweight design (89g) makes it portable and easy to carry around. It’s great for gaming on the go or as a replacement for a laptop trackpad.What Could Be Better:Size and Comfort: This mouse is on the smaller side, which might be uncomfortable for those with larger hands or who prefer palm grips. I found myself using a claw grip to get the best control, but it may not suit everyone’s ergonomics.AA Battery Requirement: While the battery life is great, I would have preferred a rechargeable option for convenience. Having to keep spare batteries around can be inconvenient in the long run.Limited Features: It lacks some advanced features like customizable weights or RGB lighting found in other gaming mice at this price point. Additionally, there’s no Bluetooth support, which would have made it more versatile for non-gaming use.",4,NA

The precision of the sensor is unmatched, making it perfect for both gaming and simple web browsing. The hand feel is simply spot-on, fitting comfortably in my hand for hours on end without any strain, not to light and not too heavy. The customizable RGB lighting adds a nice touch, allowing me to personalize my battle station.What stands out most is the durability and build quality, where other mice start missing or double clicking my Razer mouse stands strong. The mouse feels solid and well-constructed, clearly built to last. Plus, the audibly responsive buttons and smooth glide are a dream for anyone who values quick, accurate movements.Obviously, the Razer mouse has exceeded my expectations in almost every way.

"50","Mouse","Razer Basilisk Customizable Ergonomic Gaming Mouse","Bryan Snow","Reviewed in the United States on November 12, 2024","","Pros:- software support for razer software suite. Includes macros and every other function you would need.- sensitivity clutch is useful for shooters or as a modifier switch.- ""hyper shift"" the clutch mentioned above can be used to activate a secondary layer of controls. Holding it activates the layer and it's specific bindings, releasing returns to first layer of bindings. This effectively multiplies the usable buttons.- mouse wheel features tactile and speed modes, with additional behaviour customizations as well.- smooth gliding feet, no snags.- braided cable is extremely premium.- wired mouse for those who prefer it (like me)- plug and play . Functional and usable even should you choose not to install the software suite.- durable. I have purchased three basilisk line products from razer. My v2 lasted 2 years and was still perfect when I swapped to a v3. That v3 lasted a year and I just gifted it to my cousin. This one is my 3rd device and I have confidence in this brands durability.- 26k dpi max- supports ""stages"" of sensitivity that can be increased or decreased with two buttons behind mouse wheel. The stages dpi value can be altered using the recommended partner software suite from razer.- stylish design, appealing to the target audience.Cons:- sensitivity clutch is not removable. The v2 version has a clutch that works the same and CAN be removed. This product (v3) has the same but it CANNOT be removed. If this matters to you.Verdict:Many make fun of razer as being an edgelord brand and joke about it, but the truth is gimmicks and image aside every new product I've purchased from them has performed at or above expectations and was durable. This mouse is a great value for its functions when you are using razers connected software suite. However if you do not wish to use a software suite you may desire a mouse with more programmable buttons. This for me though is perfect. Clean because only necessary buttons, yet hyper shift allows me more when needed.",5,NA

Even though I didn’t need a gaming mouse, this one stood out for its features and price, which beat the pricey Logitech MX Master lineup. It’s a fantastic value and has become my new favorite desk companion.OverviewThe Basilisk V3 is a joy to use. Its ergonomic design, customizable buttons, and satisfying scroll wheel make it a productivity powerhouse, even for non-gamers. And let’s talk about the RGB lighting—it’s completely unnecessary but so cool. Customizing it has been more fun than I expected!That said, there’s a slight learning curve with Razer’s Synapse software, but it’s worth investing the time. Once you tweak the settings, you unlock the full potential of this mouse, and it makes a real difference.Final ThoughtsMy only gripe? I wish it were a tad bit bigger—an “XL” or more productivity-focused version would be amazing. But for the price and features, this mouse is unbeatable. Whether you’re gaming or just working, the Basilisk V3 delivers serious bang for your buck. I'll be getting at least one more (to pair with other computers). Highly recommend!",5,NA

And for the price point I thought this was very nice, since it's like a $16 mouse.The colors are great, I would have gotten the blue and white one but I really like the black & yellow. The click is perfect, realy subtle and quiet, and it's a really smooth mouse. My hand is big so I naturally wish it was slightly larger, but I think it's perfectly sized for most people.It's USB-charged which I love, I cannot keep buying batteries for my mice! And the battery level displays in my Windows settings. Haven't found a similar feature on my Mac unfortunately.It has USB and two bluetooth connections that you can switch between using a button on the buttom. My other Logitech mouse has channel-changing using three buttons on the side of the mouse so you don't need to stop using it to change, but this is just a differently-purposed device. I actually prefer the button being in an inconvenient spot because I know it will only serve one use at a time and I won't be clicking on the wrong device, which has certainly been an issue.The programmable buttons are really nice, I have bound them to toggle voice in games and cycle through items, and it's bound as a forward and back button in web browsers out of the box. I haven't bound it to any navigation purposes on either machine because I hate those features, but if you're multitasking it would probably mitigate the confusion considerably.Overall, I just love that it works exactly the way I want, it's small, it's super light and it's sleek.

Here’s a breakdown of my experience:Pros: • Build Quality and Design: The Spatha X is a marvel of engineering, with a robust build that feels durable yet is surprisingly comfortable for long gaming sessions. The customizable RGB lighting adds a sleek, personalized touch to my setup. • Performance: The precision is top-notch. Whether I’m in the heat of battle in an FPS or maneuvering through complex designs in CAD software, the tracking is flawless, and the adjustable DPI settings are a game-changer. • Battery Life: Impressive for a wireless mouse. I can go days without needing to charge, even with heavy use and RGB lighting on. The charging dock is not only convenient but adds a stylish aspect to my desk. • Customization: The plethora of buttons (12 programmable ones!) are a dream for MMOs and productivity tasks. The ROG Armoury Crate software, while requiring a bit of a learning curve, offers deep customization for lighting, performance, and button configurations. • Connectivity: Seamless switching between wireless and wired modes is a massive plus. The wireless connection is stable, with no noticeable lag or disconnects.Cons: • Size and Weight: Gamers with smaller hands might find the Spatha X a bit bulky. It’s also on the heavier side, which I personally like for the stability, but it might not suit everyone. • Price: It’s an investment. The Spatha X is on the higher end of the price spectrum for gaming mice, but for the quality and features you get, I find it justified.Conclusion:The ASUS ROG Spatha X Wireless Gaming Mouse has been a fantastic addition to my gaming rig. Its combination of stellar performance, customization options, and durable design make it a standout choice for gamers looking to elevate their play and productivity. While its size and price point may not appeal to everyone, those willing to invest in a high-quality gaming mouse will not be disappointed. Highly recommended for serious gamers and professionals alike.",5,NA

I'm not sure if it is a firmware issue or a hardware issue, but be aware that using the ROG Chakram X Origin in Wired mode will cause the mouse to act weird. From not being able to move the mouse cursor, to not being able to click anything, to the side joystick glitching and moving in one direction. Oh about the joystick; DISABLE IT. It is incredibly jank and not worth using. It also HEAVILY interferes with any controllers you may have connected to your PC.2/5 Stars.Conclusion: The Spatha X is a chunky mouse that has terrible side button placement but fits perfectly for people with big hands. The Chakram X Origin is good ONLY if you plan on using it in wireless mode exclusively. It is a lesson in frustration using this mouse in Wired Mode.",5,NA

I have big hands and I work long hours on the computer and I've struggled to find a mouse that is comfortable. This one fits perfectly and is the absolute right size. All the fingers fall perfectly where they should and it even has a contoured shelf for the ring finger. The buttons are tactile and quick. The scroll is smooth. There is near 0 latency. The looks are absolutely wicked. It's perfectly weighted and just glides across the surface. The ROG aura lighting is absolutely gorgeous. And I love the docking station. It's perfectly magnetized so the mouse just slides into the perfect spot to charge. Some might say that it's very expensive but if you ask me, there is no quality without cost and I own a range of rog products and can say, with absolute confidence, that the quality is unmatched.

"102","Mouse","Logitech 910-005867 M575 Latin America","Roger Sinasohn","Reviewed in the United States on July 6, 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","So I've been using Logitech thumb-based trackballs since they were rectangular and connected with a DE-9 serial connection.  I swear by them and have converted many others.The advantages are clear: you don't need huge swaths of desk space to move them around, you can remove your thumb from the ball so you don't inadvertently move the cursor when you click, and the interface is extremely intuitive and easy to use.  The biggest disadvantage is that they are solely right-handed -- my two lefty kids can't use them.  The kids also say they're not great for gaming so that might be a factor; my youngest uses some specialty mouse designed specifically for gaming.As for this particular model, it's not terribly different from the previous M570.  Note: in the pictures, the new M575 has the more silver ball; the one with the more blue ball is an M570.The forward/backward buttons (between the left mouse button and the trackball) are less prominent on the newer model and include indentations that appear to be simple circles.  I'm guessing that the circles are meant to give your finger a reference point to be able to click without looking but I find them more annoying than useful (they feel like there's a piece of dirt or something stuck to them) and the prominent buttons of the M570 were easier to feel, as well as being less susceptible to accidental clicks.The palmrest part of new M575 as some subtle ribbing, probably meant to keep your hand from slipping from side to side but it's honestly just another annoyance.  Not enough to prevent me from using it but given the choice, I would prefer it without.The activity light/battery warning light has moved from just behind the forward/back buttons to the middle behind the main mouse buttons. Not a problem at all, just different.  I will note that the light on the M570 can be seen even when your hand is on the trackball whereas this one is covered up by your hand.The trackball itself is fine; I think I like the old blue color better but there doesn't seem to be any other difference.The bottom of the trackball is not functionally different from the old version and it's good to see that the slot is still there in the battery compartment to hold the receiver.  The power switch is a little smaller and harder to access but still perfectly functional.  There is a new button that appears to switch the trackball from using the receiver to using bluetooth -- a handy feature if you want to use it with something like a tablet, I suppose.  (I've not tried it via bluetooth.)If you're thinking about upgrading from an older M570, you'll feel right at home, for the most part, but I don't think there's any compelling reason to rush right out and get one.  I bought a new one because the scroll wheel on my old one stopped working reliably.  Had it not, I'd still be using the M570.  (Note: I still use an M570 in my office, as does my wife.)If you're new to this style of trackball, imagine laying your hand on a gently curved rest and moving your thumb around.  It's comfortable and less stressful than a traditional mouse and it requires a lot less free desk space.  It doesn't need any particular type of surface; I've used it with it on my leg, on the bus seat next to me, and on my bed.It's not the cheapest device in the world but if you're hesitant to spend $50 on a trackball, you're probably not a heavy or serious user.  Gamers will probably look elsewhere and possibly even pay more; casual users will be looking for something in the $15-25 range.  I'm in front of a computer 8-12 hours per day and I don't mind spending a bit on something to make that experience more efficient and more comfortable.  If you want to try a trackball without spending as much, there are some decent knock-offs on Amazon that should be fine.  But if you don't mind investing in something like this, it's well worth it.",5,NA

And for limited space these kinds of trackball devices are a life saver from a mouse.There is a “learning curve” as you want the use of it to become more natural. I’ve played around with some settings to make it less sensitive as I wasn’t use to moving things and click dragging.So far it has caused some discomfort in my hand as it’s using muscles that aren’t likely used that way but again that isn’t the device. That’s my physiology. The device itself works good so far. Be it a mouse, a trackball, a trackpad or whatever, they all offer benefits and tradeoffs. This is working for my situation.",5,NA

Most inconvenient and painful!  Logitech trackball to the rescue! Trackball use cannot cure RSS, but it might do wonders to ease your discomfort/pain as it did (and still does) for me.Nowadays, trackball mice are getting difficult to find as user needs and interests evolve.  I kept searching for a NEW (not refurbished) Logitech trackball and finally found this model.  There are very few changes between this trackball and my previous similar Logitech models; those micro-differences don't matter to me.All I care about is that my new Trackball is working perfectly for my needs.  Scrolling has always been the primary indicator that my trackball was wearing out.  My new Trackball's scrolling is reliable and smooth.If you're still old school in some of your tech habits as I am, this Logitech wireless trackball may be your best replacement or a good introduction to using a trackball mouse.  Wireless, no cords to tangle (or find a spare port to plug into is a big plus!I anticipate I'll get another 10 years of trackball use out of this new model.

That's it... and Bluetooth, so no wires!  It's super easy to get used to the ball for moving the curser around the screen.  And, as I am a clutz, I routinely knock my mouse off of the arm of my couch, usually the ball just jumps out of its seat and I stick it back in and keep on going.  This mouse is nearly indestructible.

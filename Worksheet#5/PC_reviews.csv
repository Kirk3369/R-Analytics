However, it was time for my young son to begin his foray into gaming and I ordered this computer as a good machine for a reasonable price last week. It arrived very quickly, easy to set up (we had an issue with the mouse but tech support took care of that hiccup the same day so no complaints). We've been using the computer pretty much four or five hours a day gaming since it arrived and the games run smoothly and without any issues. The design is actually very nice, the multiple fans help ensure it's not going to overheat and all in all, we're very pleased.",5,NA

"17","PC","MSI Cubi NUC Barebone Desktop","Justabobby","Reviewed in the United States on September 14, 2024","GreatBuy for my drop shipping business","The MSI Cubi 5 is a disappointment.  The UEFI has issues.  The PC runs hot.  I kept it, but would not buy again.""Secure Boot"" could be turned off only if the UEFI is accessed through an OS with a valid signed key. Windows or recent Linux Ubuntu/Mint work.  Search the web for ""msi cubi 5 secure boot violation"".  I have had other issues but since I don't see forum posts from others with these issues it may be my own capabilities.  I had recent MX and Sparky running but don't assume that you can easily boot just any Linux distribution even with secure boot off.  For example a Nobara flash drive that boots on other PCs does not boot on the Cubi 5 (but again, a more capable user may find success).I usually run the Cubi and most PCs in default Linux ""powersave"" mode.  At 0% CPU use, CPU temp is mid 30C.  At ~12% it is mid 40C.  At ~15% it is mid-high 50C.  At 20% it often hits 60C.  At 20% CPU use this PC is not silent because of fan noise.  A Lenovo laptop with the same CPU at 15% runs about 15C cooler (same software - temps determined by gkrellm).Otherwise the MSI Cubi 5 is OK.  Everything works (haven't used wifi) with Linux Mint.  It is small yet holds both an NVMe and a 2.5"" drive.  For a user with little expertise, the more powerful Cubi 5 has been a disappointment.  A more capable user may find it a fun challenge.",3,NA

"19","PC","MSI Cubi NUC Barebone Desktop","William Robert Cleghorne","Reviewed in the United States on January 26, 2024","","Product purchased as a basis for a Kodi-based HTPC.  The Cubi was simple to plug in and turn on, and thus far works well.I docked one star because of the confusion involved in installing an internal hard drive.  The MSI website describes an optional baseplate that can be installed to accommodate a 2.5"" internal drive, in the case that you don't want to use an external USB hard drive.  This unit did not come with the second baseplate, and there is no mention of how to install a 2.5"" drive even though the unit did come with a SATA adapter and various screws for mounting an HDD to the hardware.In the end, you *can* install an internal HDD, but the process is a little convoluted:1) remove the existing baseplate, and locate the SATA port in the small space behind the DIMM2) remove the two screws holding the DIMM in place and remove the DIMM.  Attach the SATA adapter to the port.  You need very small fingers (or appropriate plastic tools) to do this.3) replace the DIMM and reinstall the DIMM mounting screws4) attach the HDD to the other end of the SATA adapter.  You need to do this *before* you attach the HDD to the baseplate.5) now line up the HDD mounting holes to the corresponding holes on the baseplate and attach with provided screws6) reattach the baseplate to the CubiOf course none of this is necessary if you opt for an external USB HDD instead of an internal HDD.",4,NA

Videos are crystal clear AND smooth. AMD iGPUs can't touch this !!! Some people actually don't care about gaming. So sad that all videos on YouTube are focused on games. The 64 EUs on this chip work MAGIC. Intel CLEARLY demolishes AMD for internal graphics. The price for this unit is a crazy GOOD deal !!! You can get an OEM license for Windows for around $15. Yes, it is legal too. Retail Windows can be used from PC to PC. OEM windows is tied to the motherboard. Can't be used for another PC, unless you call Microsoft.",5,NA
"21","PC","MSI Cubi NUC Barebone Desktop","Public Name","Reviewed in the United States on January 1, 2024","3.0 out of 5 stars","In the couple of weeks that I’ve had the MSI Cubi N ADL, it has been a good, aesthetic mini PC and fast enough for my basic computer needs. I gave it 4 stars but it could’ve gotten 5 stars if:1. it had been even smaller in size, without reducing the number of ports.2. it had been fanless. Don’t get me wrong- its fans are very quiet, but they are not completely inaudible.3. it had had dual-channel RAM slots rather than single-channel RAM slot.4. it had supported power-delivery over USB-C via a smaller power supply, like an iPhone charger.5. it had been made from materials that don’t fall under California’s Proposition 65. Admittedly, other PC companies have the same problem too, but still, it was disturbing for me to notice the warning label.I also like MSI’s customer service and how-to videos on YouTube. All in all, thus far I’m content with this mini PC and I hope it will serve me well for many years to come.",4,NA
"22","PC","MSI Cubi NUC Barebone Desktop","Stephan","Reviewed in the United States on June 5, 2024","","The write-up read as though this simply doesn't have the OS installed, but it is in fact just a case with a motherboard and power supply. You need to bring your own RAM and Storage to make this usable.

"39","PC","iBUYPOWER Slate 8 MESH Gaming PC Computer Desktop SMI7N47S01","Brianna Smith","Reviewed in the United States on July 7, 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars","This image was just a temporary solution to how the cords were before. I am getting an ESD Mat to officially fix this and arrange them more properly.I've had this PC now since 2020. I have not had any issues what so ever with what I got it for which was gaming. Like Call of Duty Coldwar, Black Ops 2, Borderlands Series, Apel Legends, etc. They run great.I clean the inside of my own PC and recently I changed the Thermal because it started rising above 90 C. The first time I opened this PC the first time I cleaned it over a year ago, I noticed whoever put this PC together did not do cable management very well. They had em in zip ties which hey, good but at the same time, they pulled them on too tight. I had to carefully cut them off because nothing was unlocking them. When they came off, some of the cords had indentions in them which I don't think you're supposed to tie them too tight. There was not wiggle room what so ever. They only put the cords through two areas more near the front fans and even tied bent cords together. So right now until I get an ESD Mat, I've got a big jumble mess of cords trying to poke out. Only reason why I had to deal with it in the first place because the zip ties were so tight, the cords could not be moved at all for one, but the side panel would not close all the way. It was very unorganized cord wise and very poorly done. Everything else is great.If anyone plays big games like over 100gb's worth, I would recommend getting a bigger hard drive or an external hard drive because you would be able to get 2 maybe 3-4 games(maybe). But you need extra space for gaming performance to. It's an SDD which is good but there's not a lot of space. I would say this particular build would probably be good for people who play indie type games or games that don't require a lot of space.All in all, I'd give this an 6/10 for my experience. Minus 4 stars for the way the cords were put together.  Past 5 stars for never having performance issues with how they were done.The cooling fan I kind of don't like, when I changed the Thermal Paste in it a few days ago, this is the type of fan that you can't really get in between the heat sink and fan because of what the screw has that connects to the heatsink. It's impossible to take apart without breaking anything. So I'm considering on getting a new one at some point that I can easily maintain. And I really hate how uncomfortable it is once you get one screw out because it pops out loud and when trying to stick it back in its slot, you literally have to push down on it hard enough for the screw to be able to reach its socket. First time, I about had a heart attack because it literally sounds like something is breaking when it isn't. Either way, I don't like the fact you can't get behind the fan truly to get to the hard to reach places.It is quiet 99 percent of the time but you really hear the fans going once you launch a big graphical game like CoD. It's not LOUD but you can definitely hear the speed increase when playing and launching those type of games.Would I recommend this PC? Yes! Only complaint was cable management, storage and the cooling fan. This is a good budget gaming pc, so if anyone's looking for a cheap setup, this is it.It is also supports Windows 11 if anyone's wondering. It took me months before I realized that it was. You have to switch the TPM on yourself. You may not get the update right away but it is compatible.",5,NA
"40","PC","iBUYPOWER Slate 8 MESH Gaming PC Computer Desktop SMI7N47S01","Brianna Smith","Reviewed in the United States on April 9, 2020","","With the Covid-19 pandemic my job pivoted on a dime and mandated telework for at least two months. The second day of working on my laptop I decided I needed a new monitor so I bought an ultra wide screen one. With such a nice monitor I figured I would buy a new non-laptop computer so the laptop could be used by my kids for their school work. I did my research and having not owned a gaming PC in almost two decades I wound up pick this machine up from IBuyPower which looks to be a family run company and not a huge worldwide company.Setting up the system was a breeze, I will give you that using Windows for the first time in decades it felt really Mac like in the configuration walk through. The instructions that come with the system are one page and can be summed up as:  make sure nothing came loose inside, attach the Wi-Fi antenna, plug in power, keyboard, mouse and monitor, turn on. Easy enough although the antenna cable could be a little bit longer.Performance is top of the charts in every category. Maxed out setting in every game and plays smooth as butter. Bought a Vive VR setup and ran the performance test and maxed out in every category and boy is VR a lot of fun. I run my work environment in a window with the ultra wide monitor and the system just purrs.This was my first exposure to a SSD and man-oh-man what a speed difference. With the system powered down, pushing the power button results in a delay of seconds until the Windows sign in screen is shown. Man, I remember the days of watching the BIOS screen scrolling by and now it is so quick. Waking up the computer from sleep mode is nearly instantaneous.What else... the system is super quiet. The keyboard and mouse that come with the system are cool and work fine. I was getting 139MB/sec download speeds via the wi-fi antenna (I have the computer in the basement) but I ran a Cat-6 cable directly to the router and now am over 500mg/sec download which is nuts.Downsides: Came shipped in the IBuyPower packaging which would make it a steal target if you are not home. I would love a simple sheet of tech info on the system like what kind of RAM to buy, how many slots are available, etc. Video card only has one HDMI port which required me to buy a cable adaptor to get the Vive connected.There you have it. I have not had the chance to use tech support so I cannot comment. I am thrilled with the computer and would recommend it in a heartbeat to anyone who asked, I looks great, plays everything and handles everything I throw at it without breaking a sweat. It is nice to know I will get years of use from this machine without having to downgrade settings on games. Order it and sleep well with your purchase, you made the right choice.",5,NA

This CYBERPOWERPC Gamer Master has blown my expectations away. Not only does it outperform my previous machine, but it also handles games like GTA 5 Online on maxed-out settings, delivering consistent 80-110 fps—something my old laptop couldn’t achieve even on medium settings.The future-proof DDR5 motherboard allows for easy upgrades, whether it’s the GPU, RAM, or SSD. There’s even room to add extra PCIe connectors like USB3 and USB-C ports, which is a great bonus. The RGB lighting is a nice touch, fully customizable with the ASUS app, and I love how quiet this machine is, even under heavy load. You can control fan noise and adjust CPU/GPU performance using the Armoury Crate software.One thing to keep in mind: double-check all cables and make sure the GPU and RAM are properly seated before your first boot. The PC comes with a 16GB RAM stick from Patriot, running at 6000 MT/s with CL36 latency, which is perfect for my current needs. In the future, I might upgrade to 4x32GB RAM to boost my machine learning work.Overall, this machine is incredible—performing like a high-end gaming laptop but at a fraction of the cost, with ultra-quiet operation and excellent FPS. Plus, it comes with a high-quality gaming mouse and keyboard right out of the box. Definitely worth every penny!",5,NA

I am not sure if this is normal or what exactly that outlet powers, it appears it’s attached pretty well for now but it feels like the cable was pulled too tight when they were tucking away all the slack from the cables. Hopefully it’s nothing that comes loose in the future I will definitely reach out to the company to raise my concern.Overall I pretty satisfied with this prebuilt computer, I’ve been running WoW and starfield with no issues and I feel like I got a pretty good value in terms of price and aesthetics.",5,NA

"83","PC","STGAubron Prebuilt Gaming PC Desktop","Client d'Amazon","Reviewed in the United States on November 3, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","Let me start with the introduction. I bought this gaming pc through my mother's Amazon acct(transfered the money to her bank acct and sent her the link of which model I needed since I did not at the time have my own Prime acct).On to the PC... This package is a BEAST of a machine for the price point of $750! It's an absolute STEAL! Are you getting a 12th gen i7? No, of course not! That's how they can bring the price down and bring a better value to the customer.( I see some people complaining that it is not the newest generation i7 cpu, but to be honest the i7 they give you will literally play ANY current gen game(including cyberpunk 2077) in the highest ultra settings no problem! I use mine to send the gpu signal over HDMI 2.1 cable to my SONY Master series XR48A90K OLED 48"" 4k 120hz UHD TV. I play all my pc games at 4k resolution with maxed out graphics and ray tracing on and my FPS in games like Cyberpunk 2077 is around 52 FPS in ultra settings and 4k resolution. If I were to drop to 1440p or 1080p I would have WAAAAY more frames than that!In games like Gears of War 4 I get 196 fps on average in the highest settings and in native 4k resolution as well.I made some minor improvements to my rig as well... I cloned my SSD hd and moved my boot drive over to a higher capacity 2TB Crucial MX500 3D NAND SSD, I replaced the 500 watt ""unrated power supply"" with a Thermaltake Tr2 RX 750 watt modular power supply for more expandability and power for my components. I added a 1TB Western Digital Black high performance gaming hard drive.(I'll keep my original 1 TB boot drive as a backup in case my Crucial MX500 3D NAND SSD were to fail. I installed a new SoundBlaster Audigy 5/RX 7.1 HD 24 bit 192khz sound card. I installed a 12"" RGB LED light bar to the bottom of my case which plugs directly into the included SATA RGB controller (10 fans + 2 LED light strips/bars).I cleaned up my cables using UV reactive cable shielding.Lastly I bought and installed some ""Vath-made ""GeForce RTX"" and ""Intel Core i7 inside"" metal badges/stickers to the outside of my case.I then overclocked my RTX 3060 to +200Mhz on the gpu core clock and +900Mhz on the GDDR6 Memory clock. This setup now benchmarks using cinebench and Furmark equal with a 3060ti!I'm so happy I was able to snag this great deal and would certainly buy again knowing what I know! Don't listen to the negative reviewers out there complaining that they can't get the newest $500 cpu's in a system that only runs you $750 to start! You get everything you need to game with ultra settings in 4k and believe me... This setup WILL RUN any modern title you wanna throw at it! It has never failed to play any one of my games!",1,NA
"84","PC","STGAubron Prebuilt Gaming PC Desktop","Allie",NA,"","I got this computer and it almost immediately busted—I don’t know why it happened but I wasn’t interested in fixing the solution myself. I called the customer service and never got a response. The computer was awesome for my needs when I first got it. I strictly downloaded steam and other games from reputable sources. In the first 9 days the computer shut off randomly—I figured it was just a reset. I turned the computer back on and everything was fine. Then a week later the computer shut off again… mid-game. I went to turn it back on and a red light flashed and the computer couldn’t maintain power for more than a second.Not posting this to find solutions or anything since I returned the product. If you’re a computer wiz I’m sure you could fix it. Personally I would rather just get a working product and more responsive support team. I’ve heard they have good support which is one of the reasons I took the risk of buying the product. But once it busted and I couldn’t contact them; I didn’t want to miss my return deadline.Update:Scheduled for Amazon to pick up the package. Apparently UPS is in charge of picking up the return package. But they won’t call, text, or message you in any way.My return deadline was on the last day and UPS still hadn’t messaged me. I went to drop it off myself and they can’t print the label from the last return. I had to call Amazon who were very helpful initially switching my return process to me dropping off the computer. I had them print the labels after 45 minutes of pacing around a UPS store. I was told the package would arrive within the week. I used the support messaging app two weeks later and they knew nothing.Then about 3 weeks later my credit took a hit from the purchase holding up my max balance. I should’ve paid the balance but it felt stupid paying for something I never received in working condition.By the third week the Amazon app still said it never delivered even though I showed them the tracking number and everything.Update:I am writing from a month after the three weeks 08/24/24 and the Amazon return system is appearing like they never received the package…. Oh and I’m still forced to pay the charge even after reporting to my cc company about it.",4,NA

It was easy to setup like it literally took less than five minutes and my games runs well when the wifi is not messing up. Overall if you are like me and game lightly and woulda’t mind your Wi-Fi cutting out every couple of hours for like 3 mins then I’d say buy lol",4,NA
"86","PC","STGAubron Gaming Desktop PC Computer","Merritt","Reviewed in the United States on April 30, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","I bought this PC last year as I didn't have time to build my own between work and college. I mainly just wanted to play Baldurs Gate 3 asap, and this did the job. It has been surprisingly reliable beyween gaming and homework, and I can't say that I've really had any issues with it so far. I do want to point out though – the parts (cpu, gpu, ram) are definitely not even close to the latest models. It has DDR3 RAM which surprised me to find out, when DDR4 has been the standard for some time and DDR5 is becoming more popular. I also upgraded to a Samsung NVMe M.2 2TB SSD which helped also, since it only included a 512GB SATA SSD I believe. The 1660 ti is a good GPU, even though it's been out for quite awhile. I've found it can handle just about any game I've tried so far on at least medium to high settings normally (auto detect settings on bg3 even puts it at ultra). Also, it doesn't include integrated wifi, so you'll need to buy a USB wifi dongle if you're not connecting it directly by ethernet cable. I believe someone recommended one in another comment (which I did purchase for about $20 and have had no issues). Ultimately, if you're looking for a relatively low cost PC that will (mostly) be ready out of the box then I do recommend this PC based on its reliability, ease of setup and absence of issues thus far. However, is this the best prebuilt setup available for the price? Probably not. For better value, I'd recommend searching Microcenter or Newegg's deals (especially refurbished). If I remember correctly, I did receive this PC pretty fast after ordering with Prime. If you're in a hurry I suppose that could be justification enough. It mostly comes down to whether you're prioritizing overall value or convenience. I'm in the process of putting together my own AMD build now, but I have to say this PC has served its purpose quite well over the last year.",5,NA

After a week of messing around with the cords I got it finally turned on and the computer language was set in Spanish. So I used a translator to get through setup mode, once setup my son could finally play. After playing for maybe two months he had problems with cord again, so I bought a new cord and we got it working again until recently when he turned it on and got a startup message saying problem starting windows. After contacting computer professional I was told there was a problem with the windows and computer needed to be replaced. I do not recommend this product and wish I did more research before throwing $600 down the drain.  Do yourself a favor, if you are not knowledgeable in computers I would search for another brand because this was a waste of money and time. After having for only a year it stopped working completely.

It seems this company has a semi ""bad rap"", but what we got was pretty awesome for the money. Let's start with the GC, it came with a 2060 S, although it is a dated graphics card it is can handle most games seamlessly at 60fps. Next the i7 processor although there could have been a better processor in it, so far it hasn't slowed ANYTHING down, and that can easily be upgraded later on if need be. This machine came with 32 gigs of ram! It's crazy fast and responsive! I tried and tried to build something comparable and honestly couldn't come close for the money. Visually,  it's a really cool looking unit with lots of leds and functional fans. Also, the soundbar it came with is actually pretty cool. The peripherals work ok, but once again, those things can all be upgraded very easily and imo were just bonuses anyway. The tower alone holds its value plus some.If you are looking for a good solid entry level gaming pc on a budget. This thing sort of kicks a#$!(Follow-up review)We have had the PC for just over a month and it's working great. We did have a small issue with the WiFi card, where it would drop connection.

You’ll need to upgrade the graphics card if you plan on playing modern triple AAA games. Although after a year of having this PC and not upgrading its graphic card.

It's been a smooth ride from the moment I plugged it in. The BIOS update was quick and painless, and the board has been running flawlessly ever since.While I can't speak to the longevity of the board just yet, the initial experience has been excellent. If you're looking for a reliable and feature-rich motherboard for your AMD Ryzen build, the MSI MAG B550 TOMAHAWK is definitely worth considering.",5,NA
"5","Motherboard","MSI MAG B550 TOMAHAWK Motherboard","Skungili","Reviewed in the United States on September 27, 2024","","Picked this board up as a replacement for a Gigabyte AB350 Gaming 3 which died on me and It's been a smooth transition which is refreshing since this is my first MSI board, I've only used Asus, Asrock & Gigabyte in the past. My 5600X worked immediately without requiring a BIOS update though I highly recommend downloading and flashing the latest BIOS update from MSI's website as soon as you complete your setup to ensure stability. It's a very simple process and for those who are new to bios flashing, just look up a video on youtube.Overall, this is a solid motherboard and I'm satisfied with my purchase. If you like the features it offers and don't mind spending a little extra, opt-in to getting the upgraded version with WiFi.Though your mileage may vary as we all have different specs, here are the pros and cons of this mobo based on my personal experience with it:Pros:Nice features for the price point (2.5G LAN, PCIe 4.0 support, .etc)Sleek design with heatsinks that will compliment the look of any system,Two M.2 slots with protective plating, that don't disable any SATA ports like my previous board,Plenty of SATA ports & fan headers,Easy-to-use BIOS compared to other brand setupsCons:Only 6 back-end USB ports (Not a big deal, but more would be nice without the need of a hub)The on-board LED is in a weird spot. While the light is visible in my third pic as a close-up, bigger GPUs may block it almost entirely. This can be switched off manually on the board itself though. Also, to customize the LED options you have to use the MSI Center program's Mystic Light feature. I would've preferred built-in RGB settings through the bios.Did not play nice with my Corsair Vengeance LPX 32GB RAM, caused BSODs multiple times with XMP both on and off,  and despite working flawlessly on my old board. Currently works fine with an old 16GB 3200mhz kit though.",5,NA

LOLonly thing new to me on this board is rgb and argb thing and right off the bat i made the mistake>>>WARNING<<< i bought  a three pack of thermaltake rgb fans. was all the best buy had nearby. of course it needs the usb plug but my wifi needs it as well as my front panal connections. that lead to the purchase of ""Motherboard Internal USB 2.0 Hub 9 pin USB Header Male 1 to 4"" wich you guessed it needs the usb pins. just read how the signals are split on this thing. i placed the wifi on the mb. i set the rgb hub on one side then the font panal on the other side so signals are not sharing or splitting one side in half.",4,NA

"17","Motherboard","JUXIESHI Motherboard Support Desktop HDMI Compatible","Gordon D Current","Reviewed in the United States on August 23, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","I used this motherboard to upgrade an older Acer Aspire AXC-703G (mfg on 04/26/2015) where the CPU was not removable, Intel Celeron J1900 2.0Ghz.  I already had a CPU (Intel Core i7-7700), 32GB of DDR4 (2x16GB). and a 1TB M.2 PCIe3.0 Solid-State Drive (SSD) that will fit and is compatible with the new motherboard.  The only items left to obtain was a 500W power supply designed to fit into a small-form factor (SFF) case, and a low-profile CPU Fan also designed to fit into a SFF case such as this Acer Aspire.  I knew the technology and solutions for SFF cases were already out there and available. So, it wasn't a problem since Amazon already had vendors and sellers that had these items.  The Apevia power supply was an excellent choice and was smaller that the original 80W power supply.  And, the Noctua NH-L12Sx77 Low-Profile CPU Fan is designed for SFF cases and the cooling ratings were the best on the market for these applications.  As a result, I was able to upgrade this PC that was almost 10 years old with minimal cost and effort.  It's not a gaming platform, although it could've been updated to that level, but for the average desktop PC, the performance is ""off-the-charts"" when comparing benchmarks with the older Acer Aspire.  This Juxieshi motherboard worked as designed with no issues. So, if you're considering throwing away that older PC, you might want to consider this here.",5,NA

"28","Motherboard","ASUS ROG Strix Gaming Motherboard","Misnad Haque","Reviewed in the United States on June 15, 2024","","Got this mobo at circa $180 and it was a pretty awesome deal especially since this model isn't available in Sri Lanka. The board is very stable, no issues whatsoever and provides excellent connectivity. The fact that it has Wifi 6 is even better. I like this antenna unlike the triangular one from the usual TUF series. The only issue though is that despite the ROG branding, it doesn't have a usb-c header for the front panel so be mindful of that. It also has a single ARGB header so if you need more devices to connect with Aura Sync, you'll need a hub. I loved the 2 M.2 heatsinks for the drives since my previous TUF board only had 1. The IO shield fixed as a single unit at the back is great and saved me a lot of pain (yes, fixing an IO shield is a nightmare on some cases!). One callout though is that the Wifi device was not recognized by Windows 11 via a fresh install so I had to connect it via Ethernet, update the drivers from the Asus site and then got it to work. Excellent all-round board to wrap up the AM4 line-up.",5,NA
"29","Motherboard","ASUS ROG Strix Gaming Motherboard","J.D. S","Reviewed in the United States on January 28, 2024","RUNS LINUX MINT VERY NICELY.","This is a really nice motherboard and was an upgrade over my older & much cheaper B450 that I, by a tragic mistake, dropped (literally) and accidentally broke. Visually, this ASUS motherboard I’ve replaced it with is stunning, much nicer than my last motherboard with larger & better looking heatsinks.For clarification, I bought the WiFi II version of this motherboard. Software-wise, well, I couldn’t get the WiFi or Bluetooth to work right away, but I found the required drivers included on a DVD. After inserting the DVD, there’s clearly marked drivers for the WiFi & Bluetooth. Unfortunately for me, the files didn’t seem to work in Windows 10 for Bluetooth, but it did for WiF, which was more important to me. Windows Troubleshooter couldn’t get the Bluetooth to work, and the drivers I tried from the ASUS website didn’t work either in getting Bluetooth to work. Anyway, it’s not worth returning over or going to great lengths to troubleshoot outside of the windows Bluetooth troubleshooter, as I had a cheap Bluetooth adapter I bought for $5 years ago, which I just plugged in and it worked right away. One of the first things I did also was disable the “armoury crate” auto-download in the BIOS. I thought that for a nearly $200 motherboard, it was strange there were even such bloatware options in the BIOS on top of included Bluetooth I couldn’t seem to get connected to anything. That was something I more expected out of a motherboard in the barely-over-$100 price range.It’s still a 5 (or maybe 4 1/2) star motherboard to me because despite the two little complaints I have about the motherboard, it still functions very well, handling a Ryzen 7 3800X with my H100i cooler quite well while also looking great. The RGB lighting on the motherboard looks great. WiFi works very fast with the included drivers on a DVD. (Although, in 2024, I’d like to maybe see drivers located on a cool USB) I had more fan headers on the motherboard than I had fans, which was nice.",5,NA
"30","Motherboard","ASUS ROG Strix Gaming Motherboard","Zr0Regrets","Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","This board replaced a dying X470 Asus Crosshair VII Hero motherboard. I would have liked to buy an X570 chipset board, but they are out of stock everywhere, overpriced, or used and as a personal rule a motherboard is the only part of a build I won't purchase used.With a 5950x the board out of the box with PBO enabled ran TDC-156, EDC-190, PPT-230. The VRMs were warm but not out of spec or concerning so this board can handle any AM4 CPU you throw at it. It can't match the raw power output of my Hero VII board but unless you have the ultimate golden sample 5950x with a custom loop you should be able to get the clock speeds you want without burning up the VRMs assuming you have solid airflow in your case.I run custom PBO settings that have been thoroughly tested on my old board, I put my old settings in the BIOS on this board and all benchmark scores were matched or slightly improved.One big benefit with going to a B550 chipset from X470 is now I can run my memory at 3600MHz without any stability issues. My old board didn't like anything faster than 3200MHz. Also jumping to PCIe 4.0 for M.2 and GPU is great to have. I moved a 2TB Samsung 980Pro from my old board to this one and while the raw speed difference isn't noticeable the latency is.I saw a lot of complaints about the onboard LAN controller and so far, I haven't had any connection drops or speed issues. I have multiple mapped network drives connected to my PC and move a large number of files back and forth daily and I haven't picked up any dropped packets while monitoring the connection. Asus and Intel just released a new driver in late September 2024 so maybe that resolved some of the issues, but I will update my review if any problems occur. The Wifi and Bluetooth seem fine with my light testing. I have the antenna on my desk in a large open room with a Unifi AP about 25ft and 1 wall away so signal is not an issue. I always use a hard-line connection over Wifi but it is nice to have anyway.As of now my only complaint is the onboard audio, it is a step down from my Hero VII, while they share the same codec, but the Hero VII had an ESS ES9023P chip, and this board it seems does not. I'm in the process of replacing my old external DAC so that issue with resolve itself.I got this board on sale and so far, am very happy with it. I will update my review if any issues pop up. For the price (on sale) it is very hard to beat.Good luck with your builds!",5,NA

"39","Motherboard","ASUS TUF Intel® 12th Motherboard Thunderbolt","Vitality","Reviewed in the United States on September 3, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","Cut the cost in half buying through Amazon's Used option. Inside a generic brown box, it was carefully and safely packaged for shipping. It arrived in two days! The board works flawless with all of the features that I was looking for and expected at half of the price if buying it new. There are a lot of people that ship items back without ever even using them, and I highly recommend this option and this motherboard. If someone were to choose to buy this at it's current new price, this model is still a great choice. I'm just not sure for the full price that I personally would have went this route, because other models with the same options are available. It is a fantastic board, looks great with it's sleek all black military tough vibes going on. It has a very subtle RGB lighting effect on the top right corner. The setup is very simple and easy, but I've been putting computer builds together for over 25 years. Also my Lian Li Dynamic XL RGB case I've installed this board into is quite massive and would make almost any build super easy to assemble. So the ease of assembly really depends on not just skill but the case it is being installed in as well. This is a full sized board, and not a small mATX. My experience with the bios of this board and all of the features are as expected. I've definitely favored Asus for years now. This board has had no issues with my 13600k processor, or my two sticks of DDR5 6000 memory. I've easily enabled the xmp memory profile, and overclocking features to test and they all work as they should with my 13600k P-Cores hit an astonishing 5.7Ghz. After the test I've set the board back to it's default settings. Then adjusted the thermal limit and CPU voltage, setting limits, as well as making other various adjustments to ensure a very long lifespan. It is not required, but my preference. I very highly recommend this board, and am really glad that I chose to buy it used in good condition through Amazon. While I can definitely understand that this decision on such an important component for a computer seems like a very high risk, for me it was definitely worth it, costing me only half when comparing the price of new. Overall I'm left with no regrets and big savings on a high quality, top shelf, stellar product.",5,NA

"41","Motherboard","ASUS TUF Intel® 12th Motherboard Thunderbolt","Quoleo","Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2024","Absolutely Amazing!! HUGE deal when Buying Used","This is an excellent and very practical motherboard, suitable for both gaming and everyday tasks. While it may not have a PCIe 5.0 x4 slot for an M.2 SSD, it does have a PCIe 5.0 x16 slot for graphics cards and other expansion cards. Since it was released before WiFi 7, it still has WiFi 6E, but since WiFi 7 and PCIe 5.0 SSD's are both very recent with very few devices on the market that can actually use these technologies, these trade-offs have very little impact. The included heatsinks for 3 of the 4 M.2 SSD slots are excellent. I have yet to see my SSD's rise above 32 degrees Celsius, even when gaming. It would have been nice if this model came with a Thunderbolt 4 port on the rear I/O panel, but they have to make extra money somehow. The motherboard includes a Thunderbolt 4 header and an extra USB 2.0 port to allow for one of their Thunderbolt 4 expansion cards. At least using one of these expansion cards in the second PCIe 4.0 x16 slot doesn't affect the bandwidth of the other expansion slots, but using a Hyper M.2 expansion card in the PCIe 5.0 slot causes the first PCIe 4.0 x16 slot to drop to x8 bandwidth and the second slot to drop to x4 bandwidth. With 4 M.2 slots though, there really isn't a reason to use one of the Hyper M.2 cards unless you feel you absolutely need a PCIe 5.0 SSD. Similarly, there isn't really any need for a Thunderbolt 4 expansion unless you need a DP-capable USB-C port or USB data transfer speeds of 40Gbps. The rear I/O panel provides plenty of USB ports as it is, ranging from 5 Gbps USB Type A to 20 Gbps USB-C. With this motherboard, I use an i7-13700K CPU and Intel XMP RAM that can go up to the processor's maximum 5600 MHz. Thanks to ASUS Ai Suite III, I was able to set up a stable OC profile with the CPU running at an average of 4800 MHz reaching up to 5900 MHz on the P-cores, and with the memory frequency set to the advertised 5600 MHz. However, since Ai Suite III requires Memory Integrity to be disabled, I followed the advice of someone on a forum and re-enabled Memory Integrity after disabling Run at Startup for Ai Suite. Thanks to that advice, I now have ASUS' AI overclock working with Memory Integrity enabled. I have updated the BIOS regularly without issue, keeping my overclock settings by saving a BIOS profile .CAP file to a USB drive before updating. After the update, I just load the profile and everything goes back to how it was. The Q-Slot has made removing my GPU so much easier. This is important because the only M.2 slot that doesn't have a heatsink gets covered by the GPU when it's placed in the PCIe 5.0 slot or the first PCIe 4.0 x16 slot. I briefly tried placing one of my SSD's in that M.2 slot, but I ended up moving it to a different slot because, as expected, the SSD got much hotter underneath the GPU than in one of the slots covered by a heatsink. If you want to use that slot, I would recommend getting an effective low-profile SSD heatsink. The Q-LED's have been very helpful with troubleshooting issues at startup. For example, the GPU LED kept coming on during startup for some time. After trying a few things, I discovered that Windows kept forcing the CPU to use its onboard graphics during startup, even if I had the onboard graphics disabled in BIOS, which is why the splash screen that allows you to enter BIOS at startup as well as the Windows loading screen never appeared through my GPU output. Thankfully, my monitor has several input ports, so I was able to connect both the onboard graphics and the GPU to my monitor, set the GPU output as the main display, and now I no longer have this issue. This really is a great motherboard, and I would buy it again. I just hope they make an equivalent of this motherboard in the future with the new BTF layout that ASUS announced so when I need a new motherboard 8 years from now, I can get the same kind of practical gaming motherboard for the BTF PC that I will inevitably build.",5,NA

I paired it with an i7-12700KF, 32 GB of Kingston Fury DDR5, and a somewhat old GTX 980.  ASUS has an option to overclock the board using their standard defaults, which gives another 15% in performance. Anyway, the board and rig is completely stable and fast.  A great setup for a great price.  Passmark says the computer is in the 91st percentile.There is a caveat, however.  Windows 11 installation media does not know about a lot of the hardware in this board.  So before you do the installation, go to the ASUS (and Intel) websites and download all the drivers you will need, especially including the Z790 chipset driver from Intel and the network drivers from ASUS.  Put them on a USB stick so you can get the hardware working after you install Windows.",5,NA

"47","Motherboard","ASUS TUF Intel® 12th Motherboard Thunderbolt","Ettereve","Reviewed in Saudi Arabia on August 24, 2024","Excellent motherboard","I installed this about 3 weeks ago and it was pretty smooth sailing. There are lots of plastic film covers on various parts to keep it from scratching during install/shipping. Remember to peel them off as you are installing.It has some LED lights that can be turned on or off in the BIOS. Speaking of BIOS, Asus motherboards always have nice, clear and easy to use BIOS software. This one is no different.One feature that I likes (but also hated) was that the screws in the M.2 SSD heatsinks were attached to the heatsink. It makes it easier for those with bigger hands to get the screw in place. In the other hand, it also made it difficult to line the screw up with the hole. I feel like there could be a happy medium there.Finding the Windows drivers was pretty simple, but on first boot, you are prompted to install the Asus Armoury Crate software. It let's you control/view the fan speeds, LED lights, see the temperatures, install latest drivers and more. It's actually a really slick idea, but the software itself is awful. It takes up a lot of memory and it crashes all the time. I suggest installing it to get the fastest drivers, then uninstall it right away. NOTE: You will need to use Asus' Armoury Crate Uninstaller tool available on their website to completely rid yourself of it.So far, I haven't had any issues with the motherboard itself. Hopefully it stays that way for a long time.",5,NA

"78","Motherboard","GIGABYTE B650 Warranty EZ-Latch Motherboard","Rick","Reviewed in the United States on March 30, 2023","","This review is for the GIGABYTE B650 AORUS Elite AX rev 1.I ordered this board because I was on an older Intel platform and I wanted to try an AMD build again. The AMD AM5 platform suits my needs since it has current modern features and is projected to have a long lifecycle and I anticipate my next upgrade to be in 5 years or so.The GIGABYTE B650 AORUS Elite AX was one the lesser expensive and full featured ATX boards with WiFi at the time of my purchase.My build includes:GIGABYTE B650 AORUS Elite AX MotherboardAMD Ryzen 7700X CPUCorsair Vengeance RGB RAMZotac GTX 1080 AMP EditionFirst, my dislikes. No printed manual. As a lifelong pc builder, I rely heavily on a manual booklet for basic info such as what slots to install memory in. How to connect front panel power, reset, hdd status led etc. Where all of the headers such as USB and fans are located.Having an online manual is good but is useless if you don't have a spare computer or laptop to use while you build your computer.Thankfully I did not have to use the BIOS flashback feature because the board recognized my CPU, a Ryzen 7700X, otherwise I would have to go online, download the manual and look up the flashback instructions.For the price I do wish that the board included a higher end integrated audio chipset. Features-wise the audio chipset is the biggest disappointment.I did not like is the top most NVME slot right above the GPU slot has a really thick thermal adhesive pre-applied to the heatsink. It is so thick that it bends my NVME drive slightly - not enough to cause any issues but should be noted.One last thing I did not like is the lack of onboard BIOS post code status LED. I had this feature on my previous motherboard and found it super helpful when diagnosing problems.Now, for my likes. I like all of the features. AM5 socket, DDR5, WiFi6, PCIe 5.0, multiple NVMe slots, plenty of USB slots, and of course RGB support. The board itself is great. Build quality is awesome, no issues with build quality or materials.I did run into a few issues though. Although these issues were encountered with this motherboard, they are not Gigabyte's fault necessarily. These issues were mostly to do with the AMD platform and chipset itself.1. The shipping BIOS ""F2"" version did not allow me to enable XMP memory profile. I had to flash the BIOS to the current at the time ""F4"" BIOS.Note that the current BIOS version as of this review is ""F5a"".2. There were a lot of stability or problems with the USB chipset or bus. File transfers over USB were very slow or slower than it should be. I have USB DAC that had a lot of noise during audio playback. These issues were resolved by installing the latest chipset drivers for the B650 from AMD directly and also updating the BIOS.Here are some recommendations based on my experience with the GIGABYTE B650 AORUS Elite AX.Definitely update the BIOS. In past generations of motherboards it is only recommended to update the BIOS to fix a specific issue you've encountered. However, in modern motherboards there are so many chipsets and features that it is important to keep up to date on BIOS versions to maintain stability, performance, compatibility, and security. AMD seems to release AGESA updates (as BIOS updates) often and this is directly tied to the chipset. Also, download the chipset drivers directly from AMD because they tend to be more up to date than the motherboard manufacturers' website.To flash the bios, just download the BIOS file for your motherboard from Gigabyte's website and extract/copy the file to a USB drive. Reboot and enter the bios and choose Q-Flash. Select the BIOS, and the board will load the BIOS to memory then prompt for a reboot and apply the new BIOS.Aside from the chipset drivers, all other motherboard drivers can be downloaded and installed from Gigabyte.Ever since, updating the BIOS and AMD chipset drivers, I have had absolutely zero issues. Performance is amazing. Stability is solid. I even run a mild overclock using the AMD Ryzen Master app and doing an auto-oc.In summary, I highly recommend the GIGABYTE B650 AORUS Elite AX if you're looking for an AM5 build. The issues I've had are specific to the AMD platform and not the motherboard itself, however because of this I would not recommend the AMD platform for novice PC builders or if you are not comfortable or familiar with BIOS updates and troubleshooting driver issues.",5,NA

Got an OS installed and the rig has stellar gaming performance.My only two jarring complaints: XMP does not work (when I tried, PC would not boot until I CMOS-reset the BIOS to default settings), and reboot does not work at all. Literally the first place I emcountered this issue was at the reboot done during the OS install. Found out from others online that these are not an isolated issue and is a noted problem with this and some of GIGABYTE's other motherboards.Still works great, but will not recommend any of GIGABYTE's motherboards moving forward on account of this very disappointing pattern of issues. Hence the 1 star. Avoid this and go with a more reliable brand like ASUS. I will bite the bullet and avoid reboots in the meantime until the next chipset generation or two is released. Because I simply have zero confidence in their ability to fix the motherboard under their own warranty, and the only thing that can change my mind is for them to replace it, free of charge, with a board that does not have issues.EDIT (1/20/24)Fast forward a month, and I see my one star is more justified than ever. Since two weeks ago, BSoD after BSoD have been happening, and a lot of my diagnostic work on it points to a bad BIOS (which this rig will not let me update using the provided Q Flash utility), or bad RAM. Some friends suggested turning on XMP will help remedy the issue, but I cannot do this as aforementioned. And the RAM is only a month and a half old, suggesting that either the motherboard's RAM slots are damaged/defective, or it's been steadily damaging it. Could just be bad RAM on arrival, but I find that hard to believe.",5,NA

"100","Motherboard","MSI B760 Motherboard Supports Processors","Vivek Anand",NA,"Dead on Arrival","It's a motherboard that won't break the bank but will still provide you most of what you need.BIOS is nothing too special, it's not the hardest to navigate but still a little messy. I was able to get what I needed out of it such as XMP enabling and changing fans to PWM, etc. I was able to flash my BIOS just fine on the most recent update and it has no problems with that. Manual is pretty clear cut, there's a nice diagram of the overall structure of it so you're not confused as to where all the headers are. If anything, you could always use the online manual and you can get an even better look. It doesn't have a ton of ARGB headers so you might need a hub, but there are tons of fan headers to work with.It's definitely not the most fanciest designs for MOBOs but again, I do like it for the price. I've heard nightmares about MSI but I haven't had any big problems or anything with mine. Overall, it's a simple motherboard that has all the functions you would mostly want, and it includes an IO shield for the back.",4,NA

The diagnostic CPU and RAM lights were a lifesaver, helping me quickly realize I hadn’t plugged in the CPU power cable all the way.I had some trouble getting it to recognize my USB for a BIOS update, but I eventually got it sorted. It boots up fast, has all the features I need, and performs well overall. It was very easy to overclock the RAM in the BIOS.My only complaints are that the wifi antennas can block USB ports on the back so you’ll have to do some adjusting to get them out the way, but it’s not a big deal.A solid choice for anyone building a AM5 gaming rig.",5,NA

"116","Motherboard","MSI B650 Tomahawk Motherboard Processors","Alex Corona","Reviewed in the United States on August 5, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","So far this has worked good.  Compatible with 7900x3d and I have team T force Delta 6000 mhz 32gb ram with BitFenix Mesh SE TG case AIO Black cooler.  The wifi works great and had no issues whatsoever except with the cases LED changing button.  Whenever I press it to change the fan LEDs the PC crashes.  Not sure if this is the motherboard or what but the fans work normally with the standard color setup.  It might be just the fan module or something I'm doing wrong.  A part from this I plugged everything in, remember ram goes into A2 B2 if you have 2 sticks, and booted it up with NVME and RX 7600xt.  It booted up restarted twice on its own and then started up.  The NVMe had windows from another PC.  The case had usb 3.0 20 pins which did not fit right into the mobo 20 pin labeled usb and I bent the pins slightly.  I bought an adapter for the usb 3.1 header and it runs just at usb 2.0 speed which is fine for me because there are plenty in the back.  I have not updated the bios nor plan to unless I run into issues of stability.  The board does have plenty of fan headers which is nice to get around too.  The board is heavy but seems well built and the cpu backing seems strong and well put so the cpu aio cooler shouldn't rip or strip the screws.  I did change out the CPU mount for a different one because I didn't like the fact of the mount only pressing down on two sides but that's just me.  I wanted support on all sides.  Bluetooth works great no issues so far on that side either.  All in all I am happy with the purchase.Update: The fans I forgot I had to connect the controller to the case hold the LED button for 3 seconds for the motherboard to have controller of the fan lights. I straightened the pins on the USB header and was able to plug in the front USB 3.0.  You need to be careful as it didn't like to slide in nicely at all hence why it bent the first go around.  I have had no issues with it at all.  I did update the bios since it patched a security flaw. The flashing of the bios was smooth.  I formatted a usb drive unzipped the file from the site and put it on the root of the drive booted into the bios and flashed it no problem.  Wifi has been great along with bluetooth.  So far no issues in performance.",4,NA
"117","Motherboard","MSI B650 Tomahawk Motherboard Processors","Raven","Reviewed in the United States on September 23, 2024","","As someone who jumped back into PC building with a focus on heavy RGB and high-performance components, the MSI MPG B650 Edge WiFi Gaming Motherboard has been working strong. From the start, this motherboard has handled my extensive setup with ease, including over 10 RGB fans, internal screens, and other peripherals that demand a ton of power and ports.The port options on this board are outstanding. It has everything you could need plenty of USB 3.2 Gen 2 ports, M.2 slots, and SATA 6Gb/s connections. These options made my build a breeze, and I had more than enough room for all my components, from SSDs to RGB headers. The PCIe 4.0 slot is great for future-proofing and ensures that I'm getting the best performance from my GPU.One of the best features has to be its ability to handle heavy loads of RGB. With so many fans and RGB elements in my build, I was worried about managing it all. Especially when it came to the board staying cool. The MSI MPG B650 didn’t even blink! The onboard RGB headers and software make customization a breeze, allowing me to sync everything seamlessly.Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 are the cherries on top, giving me ultra-fast wireless connectivity without a hitch. The DDR5 support means my system runs buttery smooth, and the AM5 socket has me set up perfectly for my AMD Ryzen 7000 Series processor.If you're into RGB-heavy builds and need a board that can keep up with high-performance setups, this motherboard delivers in every way. Highly recommend for builders who want serious performance without sacrificing aesthetics. No better value for your buck.",5,NA

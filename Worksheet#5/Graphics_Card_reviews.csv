It was causing frustrating delays, waiting for a refresh after every edit. At first I mistakenly bought an 8GB card I thought I could use to replace it, but it required a power connection I did not have. So I would have had to buy a completely new power supply. Yikes! Luckily my friendly neighborhood PC repair shop advised me to try this 4MB one, which didn't require a power supply connection. And it works great with little to no lag time after making edits to large graphic files. Recommended.",5,NA

Card is quiet.This isn’t the fault of the card itself, but I ran into a weird issue where Windows decided the driver in Windows Update was newer than the current AMD driver. The driver in Windows Update caused the card to not work correctly and throw errors on my system. Forcing Windows to stop overwriting the latest AMD driver however made things work correctly.",4,NA

"6","Graphics Card","maxsun AMD Radeon RX 550 4GB GDDR5 ITX Computer PC Gaming Video Graphics Card","Electronic Engineer","Reviewed in the United States on November 17, 2022","Worked dandy","I bought this card as an upgrade to a system currently running 3 monitors, intending to replace the HP AMD Radeon card that came with the computer with a faster one.  With the new card installed, the computer halted before windows boot with a condition of no video card detected, so (of course) no signal to the attached monitors.  After verifying that the card was properly seated and connected, and fan active, at least three possibilities remained: 1) the card was defective, 2) the card and BIOS are incompatible, or 3) that particular computer had a defective slot.  Possibility 3) was investigated by substituting the card into a second computer of the same model and configuration, again with no video card detected.Consequently, I reluctantly returned the card.  If the card was defective, I didn't want to keep it.  If the BIOS was incompatible with the card, this would require finding, then applying a BIOS upgrade, which might or might not resolve the problem.  If a BIOS upgrade fails, one possibility is that the mainboard is 'bricked', rendering that computer useless.  Neither of these outcomes was acceptable to me, so I returned the card.  Thanks Amazon.  Your easy return policy is one of the reasons you get my business.In most situations, a video card is detected during BIOS boot and operates with default low resolution until the OS boots, at which time appropriate drivers can be loaded.  I still cannot say whether this card is compatible with an HP H8-1240T, only that the card I received was certainly NOT.  I asked this question in the customer reviews section, but received no definitive answer, only novice level guidance.  Considering that new electronics are highly likely to arrive in working condition, the most likely explanation is that the card and that computer model are incompatible.",1,NA

"9","Graphics Card","maxsun AMD Radeon RX 550 4GB GDDR5 ITX Computer PC Gaming Video Graphics Card","Ben P","Reviewed in Canada on August 30, 2022","Works, but I ran into some driver issues","If you have an older machine and if you are looking for a graphics card for ordinary use and maybe some light gaming, this is a great choice. It is listed as one of the top eight cards that does not require an extra power connection, as some older machines do not provide that option. I got this card on a big sale, it arrived the next day after order, clearly new, well packaged, nice and clean and solid, no issues. Easy to install, works great with Windows 10. I used an HDMI connection to a 4K monitor (resolution 3840x2140) which worked great. I did some light gaming, no issues. Card is not noisy. The card also has good connectivity options, HDMI, DisplayPort and DVI. So as long as you are not a super serious gamer, this is a great card. Mind you, if you shop around, you can find cards like the GTX1650, 1050Ti or RX 6400 which also do not require extra power and are much more powerful graphics cards. If the prices are comparable, it would make sense to get one of those instead, BUT if you can get the RX 550 on a good sale for much less than those other alternatives, and it meets your needs, it works great!  This card is best described as ""a solid budget pick"". Worth getting if you can get it for a great price, for much less than other higher performers. If you are a serious 3D gamer, then this is not for you, although you can play lots of games fine on it.",5,NA

I needed to upgrade the graphics card on my Dell XPS 8910 tower for the purposes of video editing using Davinci Resolve 17. The card that came with the unit did not support OpenCL and had only 2 GB of memory so the program would always fail when I tried to render even the simplest videos. So I was more interested in the ability of the GPU to support video and photo editing. From that perspective I am very happy. I was able to edit a half hour worth of 4K video without having to use proxy files and the video played smoothly while editing. And when it came to rendering, it worked flawlessly. Installation was very easy and the driver auto installed after a few minutes.Gamers may have other opinions, but as a video editor on a fairly simple set up, it has been well worth the money.",5,NA

I can run MS Flight Sim at full speed and 4K. So many more games run at full throttle now. Not sure how it will do on your machine, but this works great on mine. The fans take a while to kick on which means the card isn't running hot. My CPU fan does seem to kick on sooner, though it doesn't get too hot. The OEM box isn't known to be a vent powerhouse, so it's not the cards fault. I did order another more powerful box fan, so we'll see how that goes when I get it.",5,NA

We installed them in out HP Z4 workstations and they all work as advertised.  I am unable to assess how they perform for gaming or other graphical applications except to say that between computations they also drive our 2K monitors just fine.Just the above makes us satisfied customers, but to our pleasant surprise the card also accommodates our unusual power supplies.  About every PSU manufacturer and their mothers provide additional PCIe power using 8-pin connectors.  HP workstations however are different, for their PSUs provide 150+W of power through a 6-pin PCIe connector (which is normally rated at only 75W). The mentioned pleasant surprise is that this GPU happily accepts our 6-pin connectors and still works at full power, as opposed to other GPUs we tried which refuse to power on without an adapter cable.Overall these are great, inexpensive GPGPU devices which we can recommend.",5,NA

This is not a short review!  :-)THIS IS A BEAST!But so is my setup.  I've been a gamer since PONG! heh hehTHIS YEAR is my finally realized perfect system finished.  I BUILD my own.  Have since 1990!  (8-bit Atari before that)  But this is PERFECT for my monitor setup.  I run games at 2K!  7860x1440 Resolution and though my old RTX-2070 handled it, I had to turn down graphics settings for Ultra Wide gaming.This 4070 Super handles everything in wide rez (resolution) just as well as the standard 2560x1440 rez on just ONE monitor.WHY so many monitors?While the picture is running Valheim, I wanted this mainly to run Elite Dangerous (Awesome Space Ship Flight Simulator) in the ultra wide screen (Nvidia Surround) since I have trouble with VR.  I measured this to be nearly FIVE FEET or wrap around screens (The three bottom are ASUS 32"" Curved 2K 165hz monitors with narrow bezels.  TOP is a 28"" 2K ASUS)To see ED and Warcraft and Helldivers 2 and Division 2 and many more in this wide screen is amazing.  THIS 4070 runs great framerates above 60FPS on everything.  Many run far more than 60FPS.HOWEVER, IT IS HUGE!I have this older Rosewill THOR Full Tower case. GREAT for cooling without using AIR, Not water cooling.  But I had to move a DVD drive UP a slot to get this card to fit!  I had to be patient getting this into the slot.  SO, Before you go with this THREE FAN CARD, MEASUE WELL!  The hold down screws also were difficult to reach in this case.,  The point is, Measure, this card is very LONG and tall, HUGE heat sinks that are fantastic for cooling.  I prefer the ASUS GPU-Tweak II App (slightly older but great for me) to make good use of the fans.  NOTHING gets the temps above 55C WITHOUT the fans being noisy.  I start the fans early and reach 100% at 65 degrees C.THIS LOOKS amazing, and I also use the top monitor for web pages, Discord, etc.  I share screens a lot and watch friend's screen shares, and this card handles everything without straining!  (And it's only SLIGHTLY Overclocked.)  There is no need for more OC action.MY system runs very well on an 850W Thermaltake PS.  The card calls only for 650W!System info in case you builders need more info?THIS Video card.ASUS PRIME X570 MB with the Thermaltake 850W Toughpower Gold PS.AMD Ryzen 7 3800X CPU running plenty cool on the Wraith Cooler Fan bundled with the CPU.32G Crucial Ballistix 3600 DDR4 Ram (LED, but the LED sticks were on sale and cheaper!)2x 2TB NVMe M.2 drives and a couple of older drives for extra backup.And it has been a great setup, most parts actually came from Amazon, usually on sales)THIS 4070 Super from ASUS is also more reliable in MY  opinion because ASUS uses much better quality chips/capacitors/etc. which also, admittedly, makes them somewhat more expensive.  Far more reliable in all my builds than most other brands.  (You Get What You Par For!)",5,NA

It works great.  Card runs quiet and cool with a 550 watt power supply.  When using AI program, the AI program uses the CUDA cores in the card to perform its functions, and it's fast.  Much faster than the 3060 I had before.  In fact, all my AI programs which use CUDA cores are fast, like Topaz Labs Video AI, Photo AI, Gigapixel AI.  A check of resources in use via Windows task manager shows that the card doesn't heat up too much.  The two fans will sometimes speed up but unless you're paying attention, you don't really notice it.Installation and upgrading from my old video card was quick and easy.  Installation of driver software was easy too.  A check using online evaluation software showed this video card ranks with the best, topped only by 4080 and 4090 cards on benchmarks, as one would expect.  And it does this on my 550 watt power supply, which is good because it meant I didn't have to change that out.So, if you're looking for a good, reliable video card that works with a lower wattage power supply (under 600 watts), look no further.

"58","Graphics Card","ASUS The SFF-Ready Prime GeForce RTX 4070 Super OC Edition 12GB GDDR6X Graphics Card ","Anthony Ho","Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2024","Great card, Excellent addition, and Freakin"" HUGE!","If you’re looking at these reviews, chances are that you’re uncertain which GPU is best for you. In my case I looked at the 7800xt, 7900xt, 4070, 4070ti, and 4070ti SUPER, but I decided on the 4070 Super. I purchased it for 609.99, and I wouldn’t pay any more for this card.TLDR:There is no perfect option for you if price is a consideration. If money is of little consequence, buy the 7900xtx or 4080 SUPER and move on with your life. If money, or overspending, is an issue, then what GPU you purchase depends on your preference and what gaming experience you’re expecting.Pricing:- The 4070 needs to be at $500, and 4070ti at $650 for those cards to be worth buying. Right now they are not competitively priced compared to the other 4 options.- The 7800xt is priced well at $480-500, has 16GB of VRAM, and performs 5-10% less compared 4070S, Overall it is a good value card if you’re into AMD, and it could suit a lot of mid range builds quite well. Despite those factors, it just wasn’t compelling enough for me to switch to AMD.- I see the 4070ti Super as a gimmick to please the people pleading for 16GB’s VRAM. Nvidia’s plan for the 4070ti/4080 12gb release was botched and it seems like they scrambled to make this card fit in the current market. It’s not really a 4k card, and performs about 15-20% better than the 4070S in 1440p, but that doesn’t doesn’t justify a 33% price increase. I would have bought that card if it was $700. Im glad I didn’t buy it because I would rather wait for Nvidia’s 5000/6000 lineup to see if they come out with actual planned mid range competitive 16-20GB cards.- The 7900xt is a great price around $720, and probably the card you should buy if you are willing to go with AMD and want something in the high end.Preference and Bias:My problem is that I have a bias towards Nvidia. I’ve had three generations of good performance from them, and I bet some of you do as well. With the amount of money Nvidia is investing in AI I believe DLSS and upscaling will be a big part of GPU strategy for the next couple of generations. Obviously time will tell, but if features like that can provide a premium gaming experience that rivals GPU’s 2x the price, it kind of changes the game. Latency is the biggest drawback for frame gen right now, but what if it was reduced to barely noticeable levels? I mean the point of games for most people is to unplug and have fun, and I think DLSS can really help people do that. I used FSR 2.0 on my 1080ti and it really helped me buy time on modern games so I could wait a little longer to get a new GPU. It’s possible that DLSS can push my 4070S performance an extra year and allow my money stretch that much further.My second bias is my perspective of AMD. I think AMD dropped the ball this generation and could have done a better job enticing Nvidia users with their marketing and initial pricing in early 2023. Every company is out to make a profit, sure, but AMD needs to build up their credibility through pricing like we see in the 7800xt, and their initial pricing hurt their credibility. I’m not expecting AMD to be the savior of this industries pricing, but users  should be able to look at their GPU’s and believe they are paying for a premium product. I honestly don’t feel that way about AMD GPU’s, but I would love to be wrong.MY EXPERIENCE:I upgraded from a 1080ti. I play 5-10 hours a week on a 1440p 144hz monitor and my 1080ti was way past it’s prime. This 4070 SUPER can achieve 144fps+ on the games I play, without DLSS, on high - ultra settings. I don’t play the most demanding games, and probably won’t. I play things like: Darktide, Halo Infinite, BF2042, Dead space remake, and much older games.****I will say that DLSS really smooths out the frames for me in newer games, and I honestly appreciate turning it on quality in games I get 100+ FPS native. I have more issues with game server lag and my Xfinity internet than I do with DLSS and frame gen latency. But keep in mind that I have a small pool of games.****Anyways, my PC gaming experience over the last 10 years of tells me I have 3-4 years of great gaming FPS ahead on this GPU. I play the same games for 2-3 years anyways, so my hardware needs won’t go up for at least that long. There is also no such thing as future proofing, so I know I’m going to need a new GPU in less than 5 years if I want good performance on 1440p. I just ask myself “why spend more money than I need to, when I can buy something that will be good enough for what I need for the next 3-5 years”.Build Notes:This Asus dual is a compact size, and the cooler is surprisingly efficient. I push 242W on my overclock, and in my toughest stress tests reach 58-62 C. For my current build I paired the 4070S with a 13700KF on 32gb DDR5 and it’s great. I’m sure it could be paired with a 13600K or a 7700x and be just as good. The upgrade from the Pascal generation is very significant, and I’m pleased so far. Honestly ray tracing doesn’t blow me away…it depends on the game, but this card performs very well with RT enabled and DLSS/frame gen on. It OC’s very well and is quieter than my 3 fan EVGA 1080ti. My gaming temps @80% fan speed are around 58 F.If you’re considering buying the 4070 SUPER, I encourage you to be honest with yourself about what you need. Don’t just buy something because you can get up sold, buy it because it does what you need it to do and be content with that. In the words of Qui-Gon Jin “there is always a bigger fish”.Personally, I was torn on spending $800 on the TIE SUPER, but I decided against it because I can pay $600 to enjoy the games I play. I just can’t rationalize the purchase with Nvidia’s pricing this generation. I am married, I spend a lot of time on hobbies outside of my computer, and although $200 extra isn’t breaking the bank, it’s no compelling.My advice:I bought the top of the line card in 2018 for $756, and it was a great card for 4-5 years. Spend what you can comfortably spend, and be content with your purchase. The only person that cares about your PC is you. As PC enthusiasts we need to be comfortable with a 3-5 year GPU shelf life regardless of spending $1000 or $600 on a GPU.Cheers, good luck 👍🏼",5,NA

I used it to build a cheap LAN PC so I could bring it to friend's houses for gaming sessions.(Don't forget to DL Drivers from AMD, and turn off the Zero DB fan option in the AMD driver suite, keeping the fans running keeps the card cooler from the get go)Pros -beefy cooling system - with the right fan curves, my sample stayed around 48-54C under load. I have had other rx580 2048SP models that regularly heat right up to 60-65C under load with fan curves.Easy setup - downloaded drivers from AMD's website, and was right to work testing games.Size - at 235mm it will fit most builds easily!Cons - noise - the fans are a little loud on my sample, not a big deal because I wear headphones, but just a heads upNonstandard power plug - this GPU, like many other rx 580's comes with a gaudy black and yellow power adapter that you have to plug in to your pcie power cables and the run to the card, really wish that wasn't the case.Legacy Driver support - recently the 580 series cards are being fast tracked to legacy driver support, these cards are still great budget cards, but you might not have day one support for newly released games.Benchmarks - This GPU isn't gonna win any rewards, but if you're just looking for a GPU to get you into gaming, this is a great starter! The build specs are; I3 10305, 16gb ram, and Surallow rx580 2048sp, a great snapshot for a low end system.Genshin Impact: 1080p medium graphics, 1.0 render setting 60 FPS avg 54fps 1% low (this was testing in fontaine, which is harder graphically than other regions)Fortnite: 1080p medium graphics, TSR medium, 100% render res, epic view distance, with reflections off but global illumination on. 60-70 avg 50Fps 1% lowHorizon Zero Dawn - 1080p original graphics 50-55 Fps avg 48 fps 1% lowWar Thunder - 1080p high graphics 60-65 fps avg 52 Fps 1% lowHalo MCC(tested in Reach) - 1080p enhanced graphics 60-68 Fps avg 54 Fps 1% lowConclusion - The Surallow RX 580 2048SP is a solid performer amongst other RX 580 2048SP cards on the market, and would make a solid starter or budget option for a GPU.

The description/summary here on Amazon doesn't mention you need an 8-Pin cable as far as I've seen so I wanted to let people know this before getting the thing, then finding out after installing it that they needed an extra cable they could've gotten along with their order.Also, for reference, I got an 8-Pin cable with a SATA connection to make the gpu work. Hope this helps.",4,NA

Before this upgrade, I was working with a GTX 660ti and i5-3570k. At one point, I had a GTX 980ti, which was $1000 shipped when it launched, also from Asus; however, that GPU failed after 7 years of use and I was forced to revert back to the GTX 660 ti. Now, this RTX 3050 is about on par with the 980ti from all those years ago, for $282.49 shipped, but it also has ray tracing cores and DLSS, is powered by the motherboard, and is very sleek and modular. It drives my 1440p monitor for esports at 165fps, and can also achieve 4k @ 30 fps for relatively recent single player titles, with the right settings (relying on DLSS or lowered settings, depending on the game).  My options were either the GTX 1650 or RTX 3050, and I am glad dropped the extra $100 on the RTX 3050. I know the card has a bit of a reputation online, but I think that if you're looking to modernize an older setup, are locked into Nvidia's platform, and like the idea of a modular and low powered card, this could be a solid choice!",5,NA

"107","Graphics Card","ASUS TUF Gaming GeForce RTX™ 4060 Ti OC Edition Gaming Graphics Card","SRTRANDY","Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","So I had an old gaming pc that I custom built about 9 years ago. It had the Asus Rog Strix 1060 6gb, and an old gen 4 i5 CPU. I overclocked the 1060 pretty hard for the past 5 years, and it’s been great for the most part, but not quite good enough of Microsoft Flight simulator 2020.I decided to just completely upgrade and build a newer more modern gaming pc from the ground up, and I chose this Asus TUF 4060ti, because I’ve always had great results with Asus. Always works, and they last a long time, and the build quality is absolutely perfect. Great quality materials, and the board is solid. Also, the card looks great. I always love ASUS cards because they look amazing.One thing I do not like is the 8gb of vram. I wish it had 12gb. But I knew this before I bought the 4060ti, but to be honest, I get great 60 FPS in MSFS, with the graphics settings basically maxed out, except motion blur and bloom off with Direct X11. It does struggle with DX12, but there really isn’t a huge noticeable difference with graphics quality, so I’m using DX11.People hate the 4060ti, but in reality the actual performance you get with it is great. You shouldn’t always look at the numbers and the specs.Price of this 4060ti is also great. And you get triple fans, so cooling is definitely not an issue with minor overclocking.Overall, I’m very very happy with my purchase, and I get great 80-100fps performance on basically every game/simulator with graphics maxed out.",5,NA
"108","Graphics Card","ASUS TUF Gaming GeForce RTX™ 4060 Ti OC Edition Gaming Graphics Card","Gina Tomczyk","Reviewed in the United States on November 10, 2024","","This card is fantastic and you would think there wouldn't be much difference between this one and the PNY version but there are ! First of all the ASUS 4060 Ti is already overclocked thus clock speeds are faster then the PNY version. You'll need a minimum 650 watt CPU and the card takes up 2.5 slots but it's a beast compared to PNY RTX GeForce 4060 16GB. Ti/OC cards have better cooling fans and plating plus they're already overclocked.You don't need to do anything as in my opinion overclocking a GPU these days  just ain't worth it only to get 3-5 extra FPS.By the time you 'correctly' OC your card you might have to spend a lot of time adjusting the settings ,going through the card crashing etc.Just not worth it. Do yourself a favor and even tho' the PNY one is 'thinner' ,it's also slower/weaker ! I love this card. It handles demanding games like butter. Just bump-up Core Voltage ,Power Limit and Temp. Limit to the max with MSI Afterburner and you're done.This is a pretty good card unless you really wanna play at  4K or beyond  ,in which case it still performs well but obviously not as good as the RTX 4090 or anything. Just make sure you have at least a 700 watt PSU.Mine is 800.",5,NA

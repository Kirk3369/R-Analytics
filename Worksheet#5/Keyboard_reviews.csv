This budget-friendly option has not only complied with the workplace guidelines but has also become a pleasant surprise in terms of performance.The key feel is excellent, offering a comfortable and responsive typing experience. The low-profile design ensures a sleek and modern appearance, and I appreciate how the keyboard lays flat and stays securely in place during use. Its simplicity is its strength, and it's refreshing to find a no-frills keyboard that gets the job done effectively.One of the standout features is the affordability ‚Äì it's incredibly inexpensive, making it an accessible option for anyone on a budget.

Literally everywhere. I dislike mechanical keyboards and hate the ""clicky-feeling"" that others seem to like so much. This keyboard is the only one that was full-size, not mechanical, not some weird shape, and was under $50. Beyond that, it's a basic keyboard that just works and was perfect for my needs.

"8","Keyboard","AmazonBasics Matte Keyboard QWERTY Layout","Liz","Reviewed in the United States on September 17, 2024","","After lots of online shopping and researching, I bought this basic but good keyboard as a replacement to my Dell original keyboard.  Every keyboard takes getting used to and this one doesn't take long at all.  It's worth the $11ish.  You'll be happy if you're not picky.  I type a good amount and find this to be good enough (it serves me well), esp at the price point.  Some say the keys are mushy and I didn't know what that meant until I used it.  That said, it's not bad.  You get used to the overall feel and it won't slow you down.  If you're a fast typist, then you'll be fast on this too.  It's fairly quiet, not clacky like my original Dell keyboard.It's a bit smaller L x W than my previous keyboard which is good as I was trying to save space, but it's basically a standard-sized full keyboard.  USB cord is pretty long at about 5 1/2 ft and has no problem reaching from my desk to the CPU on the floor outside my desk several feet away (there are some turns and it reaches with slack to spare).  It's actually longer than my original Dell keyboard cord.I would recommend it.  I don't love it, but good is good enough and I'm content with it.  I'd buy it again knowing what I know.  If you don't like it, return it or store it for backup as you can't lose for the price.  Or, give it away as a Christmas White Elephant gift!",4,NA

"10","Keyboard","AmazonBasics Matte Keyboard QWERTY Layout","T","Reviewed in Canada on October 8, 2024","4.0 out of 5 stars","I really liked this keyboard, I like how the buttons press and it is fairly quiet.  However it disconnects frequently such that I cannot type on it until I unplug it and re-plug it in.  I have to do this multiple times over the course of a day.  I decided to return it because of this inconvenience (didn't want to be in the middle of something important when it decides to disconnect).  I have a Macbook Pro so it's possible that the issue is because I'm on a Mac instead of a Windows machine, hard to say without testing it on a Windows machine.  I am going to buy a Mac-specific keyboard instead.",5,NA

"17","Keyboard","RedThunder Wireless Rechargeable Mechanical Anti-Ghosting","AJ","Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2024","Perfect Birthday Gift (It was worth it)","The keyboard mouse combo was delivered sept 16 2024. There is a lot I like about this product. The keyboard feels good to type on, and the mouse has good performance. For basic use these are good items. I would say that if you are a gamer, the mouse had some intermittent issues with response. NOT for gamers.All of that could lead to a good review except for a few glaring problems.1. The battery life on the keyboard is not comparable to other products. It lasts a few days, which is good, but there are other similar products that get better life.2. The keyboard has had intermittent issues where it will just stop working. This is not battery related. The fix has been a combination of restarting the keyboard, reseating the USB, or at times restarting the computer altogether.3. The mouse is dead. Did not last even 2 months and nothing I have done has been able to fix it.While I will be contacting customer support I don't have much hope for a decent resolution. Average customer support sucks in this day and age. I will edit this review with that experience at a later date.As of now, I would not recommend or buy from redthunder again.--Update--Redthunder was initialy kind enough to reach out and offer full refund. Awesome... right?No.I accepted, to which they then sent a canned how to on fixing a keyboard. wait, sorry, one little piece about fixing a mouse that wont pair. As my mouse is dead and wont turn on (yes I know how to charge it), neither of these will work for me.Still no refund.Had they not reached out, or said ""sorry, past the return date"", I would have written this off. But I despise people/companies who promise one thing then dont fallow through. Or just ignore in this case.One star. Horrid customer service, bad business, worse product... Do no purchase.",1,NA

"20","Keyboard","RedThunder Wireless Rechargeable Mechanical Anti-Ghosting","Tina Lee Miller","Reviewed in the United States on August 23, 2024","The keyboard is GREAT!","Sent me a keyboard that was opened and very obviously used, slightly scuffed. I've been using almost 2 weeks seems to work just fine though, how much would another sticker cost? just to prove you made sure it works correctly? Only get one charger when you have two items that need to be charged.It was my own fault I didn't realize it doesn't use batteries. Charging cable is extremely cheap though, took 6 hour to charge so I could use it? Presumably why previous person returned? Thankfully I had my own charger and just plug it in overnight and haven't had any issues since, but then Ive only had it a short time. Mouse feels a little cheap as well and its made for mens/larger hands so its it a little uncomfy to use it. If you have the colors on, on the mouse it tends to lag alot while using not something that's desirable in a gaming mouse. But over all I like the board, However I am very glad I bought this on sale would NOT have been happy if I paid 60 dollars for this.",3,NA

"30","Keyboard","SteelSeries Worlds Fastest Mechanical Keyboard","Bill_Ben","Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","The Steelseries Apex Pro is a superb keyboard. (Apology for the superlative!). It has been my favorite for the 10 days during which I tried seven other brands of keyboards.The typing was my easiest and best with this. I found out how much the keyboard wrist pad is useful.This, and other brands, I tried are for committed gamers. I have never played a single game, so you might wonder why I want it.This keyboard is more rugged, more resistant to passionate keyboard pounding during games. This can, and I believe, it does give it extra durability. Of course, durability and feature come with a price, but I have never regretted the keyboard design and manufacturing on that account.I do not want to paraphrase the features which are more than plenty in the ads. I like them all. The keyboard lighting is exceptional compared to others I have tested.My case has to do with guide and instruction the manufacturer publishes with the product. I must say the worst I had been exposed to was Logitech, even though I owned their products for several decades. In their case, it is a flimsy 2-page paper, where essential Logitech write-up shares its space with 9-10 other languages.My primary use of any keyboard is office type. My primary interest in the high-end gaming keyboards is the ability to create and use macros. Those macros can be used in non-gaming software, such as MS Office, Adobe, Movavi, and just about anything else.That was the place where my problem started. Inadequate documentation is common. Manufacturers count on the internet users to provide instructions for any aspect of the advertised features. If you cannot find what you are looking for you are ready for time consuming guesses.Actually, Steelseries Apex Pro is amongst the better ones. Unfortunately, there are those of us users, who had to be spoon fed the instructions despite decades of computer experience.I give Steelseries five stars, even though my initial bad guesses with the keyboard necessitated a return. But guess, the replacement is none other than Steelseries.",5,NA
"31","Keyboard","SteelSeries Worlds Fastest Mechanical Keyboard","P-Town Cracker","Reviewed in the United States on March 8, 2020","","When a rogue Win 10 update took out my Gskill KM780 RGB unexpectedly, I had to pull the trigger fast on a new KB instead of having to endure using my spare membrane board.  After a solid day of research, I took a chance on the Apex Pro.Coming from Cherry MX Browns, I had some reservations about OmniPoint.  The Browns have a tactile point which I liked.  I had tried MX Reds, and wasn't a fan of the linear feel.  With these Omni switches being linear, I was unsure but somehow compelled to pass on the Apex 7 with MX Browns and go Pro.  TBH, I was half expecting to return it.  Needless to say.... I was surprised when I hooked this up!First off... dat switch.  Wow.  SUPER smooth.  The inherent scratchiness of linear MX switches is GONE.  It feels like the keycaps are just sort of floating over the brushed aluminum base.  The adjustment ability is unique compared to most mechanical boards, bringing a true Hall Effect switch to people.  (Look up Hall Effect... gets a little complex for explanation here, but very cool)  Actuation can be adjusted from a light brush on the keys (probably overkill) to making the switch bottom out completely.  This can also be done on a per key basis. Lot of range to play with!Another key strength... the RGB lighting.  Its nothing short of fantastic.  The raised caps let the bright and vibrant lighting spill over the board itself, creating a very cool and clean lighting effect.  Even for those who don't much care about RGB lighting, it's very tastefully done here.Typing is unreal.  I spent 15 mins just typing random weirdness on a word doc just for them feels when I first hooked it up.  And for some reason, I find myself with a lot less errors compared to old board with the Browns.  I'd commonly get keypress duplication (as if I held the key down) with that switch, and with these Omni switches, it doesn't happen anymore.  Of course, these Omni switches are much quieter than the tactile Browns given their linear nature.Not much bad to say here.  Some minor gripes would be somewhat ""meh"" software from Steelseries and the keycaps being ABS instead of something like double-shot PBT caps.  The latter feel much sturdier and more premium, and I suppose one could buy some PBT caps if it was a huge issue.  Not sure how that would affect the lighting though.  The small B&W OLED screen in the upper right doesn't add much in reality, but its kind of a geeky fun thing that you can customize with whatever you want.  It does have some functionality with brightness and other features, which is nice to have versus having to use the software.  Also, only the primary keys have Omni switches.  All the F keys, num pad, and extra function keys are on a generic linear switch that feels good enough.  Would be nice to have all keys on omni switches, but it makes sense from a cost perspective and isn't a big deal to me.All in all, fantastic keyboard that towers over my old Gskill in every respect.  I really wish MS terrible updates hadn't bricked old board, but I guess things happen for a reason.  If you have the cash and want a great analog-based mechanical keyboard with adjustable hall effect switches.... this is the one for you.  Very hard to fault this board.  Steelseries done good here.",5,NA

I‚Äôve had another keyboard from the same brand and loved the mechanical feel to it and how compact it was, hence my interest in purchasing another one from this same brand and a much fuller keyboard. My last RedDragon keyboard has lasted me since 2017 and just broke in 2024.When it arrived it was neatly packaged with a great presentation once you open it. It‚Äôs very lightweight and easy to install and connect well, just plug it in and you‚Äôre set! It does have different light settings for the keyboard, which you will be able to see in the manual. The keyboard I purchased were soft keys, although I wish I purchased the mechanical one - so be mindful on your preference of keys. The soft keys are very lightweight and easy to press, no issues. Keyboard quality is great for the price, and is perfect for my needs as I just need a keyboard that works and can handle simple gaming, not much expectations in terms of speed, performance, etc. Mouse is also great for the price, but don‚Äôt expect a high quality/pro mouse as there is a big difference when you feel it/use it. You can also adjust the mouse speed from the middle button as well. Overall you get a good deal with quality & affordability.10/10, great option to choose for beginners, those who are looking for affordable sets, looking for a spare/backup set, or interested in giving as a gift. I would choose purchasing this over the cheaper in-store options since there are more reliable reviews for this product and can also vouch via my experience.",5,NA

I wanted a keyboard with good back-lighting in white that is easy to see under low lighting conditions, but I like it that there are multiple back-light color options. The keyboard is great for accessing laptop more comfortably and when sitting on couch with keyboard in lap. I can see where the blue and red might also be useful for different lighting conditions.

I was impressed with it when she had it all setup on her computer. The keystroke was nice and smooth and no loud clicking sounds like a mechanical keyboard, mind you it still makes a little keyboard stroke sound. The backlit light adds a special touch, especially if you're playing games with minimal lighting. You can set the light to either one tone ie. blue, yellow, red etc.. or a rainbow pattern that flashes across the keyboard. You can also set the speed of the flow of the light as well.The only problem is the wrist rest, it's small so it doesn't cover your entire wrist. It comes up to your palm and that's it. I used a wireless Logitech keyboard which provided a generous amount of space with its wrist rest. However this is a gaming keyboard so you might want to see if the ergonomics fits your style of playing. So far I don't have any problems with it. The mouse ergonomically fitted my hand perfectly not to mention the material provided a nice touch and grip. The braided wire added a special touch and rugged feeling. The mouse offers a 3000 DPI as well 4 level of DPI adjustment.  Having said my piece... I was taken by how it performed, look and feel that I ordered another one for myself.

"68","Keyboard","Logitech Programmable Backlighting Bluetooth Rechargeable","Vyctor Gregory","Reviewed in the United States on December 19, 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars","The MX keys is the best keyboard I've ever had. The keys are soft to the touch and quiet when they are pressed. As far as the feel, this keyboard is in between a regular desktop keyboard and a laptop keyboard. The buttons are sturdy and not wobbly. The backlight is perfect. A lot of reviewers complain about the back light not staying on, but It's best that it doesn't, because it conserves the battery life during each use, you don't even have to press any keys or buttons on the keyboard, the backlight comes on when your fingers hover over the surface of the keyboard. when your done typing the backlight stays on from 5 to 7 seconds, then shuts off. All you have to do is brush your fingers across the keyboard and the backlight is back on so you don't have to worry about pressing the wrong keys in the dark. PERFECT. If the backlight stayed on then everybody would be complaining that the battery doesn't last long enough. Logitech had this in mind when building this keyboard. Everybody is also complaining about the weight of the keyboard saying its too heavy, it is in fact heavier than the standard desktop keyboard, but that's good, because if its bumped it won't move or if it is placed on a slanted surface then the weight of the keyboard and the rubber feet will prevent the keyboard from sliding off of it's surface. My keyboard was sitting half way on the edge of my bed and half way off I sat down on my bed before I realized this. I was terrified and my hart sunk to the bottom of my stomach, because I thought it was going to fall on my hard wood floor and possibly get damaged, but because of the weight of the keyboard it didn't fall and I had a chance to move it so it wouldn't fall. The weight comes from the built in battery. I rather have a little extra weight, which isn't really a lot of weight. once you have the keyboard for a week or so you don't even really notice the weight. The weight of the keyboard is actually a BIG PLUS in my option. If your looking for a good keyboard with no latency as far as the response to the keys being pressed, then this is the keyboard. My keyboard is connected via Bluetooth and I've never had any connectivity issues. No need to worry about buying batteries I can just plug my phone charger into the Type-C connection on the keyboard and it charges right up, you can also use this keyboard while it's charging. Thank you Logitech.",5,NA
"69","Keyboard","Logitech Programmable Backlighting Bluetooth Rechargeable","Jonathan M","Reviewed in the United States on April 2, 2024","","The Logitech MX Keys S Wireless Keyboard has been a cornerstone of my desktop setup, compelling me to purchase it not once, but twice. Its design and functionality speak volumes about the thoughtfulness put into this product, making it well worth the investment.Starting with the typing experience, it's exceptional. The low-profile, spherically-dished keys are shaped perfectly for the fingertips, offering a fast, fluid, and precise typing experience that's also quiet. This feature is particularly appreciated in an environment where noise can be a distraction.The Smart Actions shortcuts, facilitated by the Logi Options+ app, are a game-changer, automating repetitive tasks with a single keystroke. It's features like these that elevate the MX Keys S from a mere keyboard to an efficiency-boosting tool.The smarter illumination is another highlight, with backlit keys that light up as your hands approach, adjusting brightness according to the ambient light. This thoughtful design not only looks good but also ensures I can work comfortably in any lighting condition.From a physical standpoint, the keyboard‚Äôs solid build and low-profile design contribute to a comfortable typing posture, reducing wrist strain during extended use. Additionally, the multi-device Bluetooth functionality and USB-C rechargeability underscore its versatility and modernity.Another note is the weight of this keyboard. It is surprisingly heavy, which, in my opinion, is a huge pro. With the rubber grips and the weight, this thing stays right where it is supposed to, whether on a glossy desk or large mousepad.Although I encountered a hiccup with the first keyboard due to an accidental spill, the replacement process led me to the updated version featuring the Logitech Bolt. While it meant using an extra USB dongle, the seamless performance and typing comfort far outweighed this minor inconvenience.The MX Keys S isn‚Äôt just a tool for typing; it's a comprehensive control center for your digital workspace. Its ability to pair with the Master 3S mouse and facilitate multi-computer control mimics a KVM setup, adding layers of convenience to my workflow.The Logitech MX Keys S Wireless Keyboard is not just a purchase; it's an investment in a smoother, more efficient computing experience. Its blend of ergonomic design, advanced technology, and eco-conscious manufacturing make it a top contender for anyone looking to upgrade their keyboard.",5,NA

This works perfectly. The keyboard itself feels very sturdy and well made. The base itself is metal and the keys are plastic but seem to be decent quality. It is a little on the heavier side but it's not unmanageable and while I wish there was some kind of case or sleeve for it, I'll just use a spare bag to make sure it doesn't get too dirty or anything in my backpack.I'm really glad I spent the extra money on this versus getting a cheaper model. I've had bluetooth keyboards before that I didn't love because they were hard to type on or had horrible lag when I was working, and as a writer, that ends up being frustrating and almost useless. This connected with my ipad immediately and if there is any sort of lag, it's basically unnoticeable. Love that it's USB-C so I only need one charging cable. The pink colour is nice (not necessary, it would work just as well in any colour, but I think the pink is cute) and I found typing to be as easy and comfortable as typing on my laptop. Overall I'm very happy with this purchase and while I haven't had it long, I've had Logitech products before that are pretty long-lasting so I'm hoping this does too!",5,NA

To begin with, several of the others I have tried were designed specifically for Microsoft or Apple devices and any supporting features or ""drivers"" were only available on those systems. While most would retain the basic functionality of a keyboard, (i.e. you could type the characters on the keyboard into the software of your choice), some would not. My prior keyboard cost well over $40.00 on sale but the led feature was unavailable without enabling it deep in the system through a command line code using XSET. The keyboard would then light up but the numerical keypad was disabled...There are NO such problems with this keyboard in Linux. Just plug it in and begin using it after your computer boots. (I'm old school I guess, I always plug any input devices prior to booting so I can not attest to it being ""hot swappable"".)The keyboard looks great when lit and the characters are easily discernable while not being to large and ""garish"". The size of the illuminated letters on each key are aesthetically pleasing and in well lit situations does not require a backlight to determine the which character/key you are pressing but are still not quite as clear as a non-lit keyboard with printed characters in high contrast. This effect is the same for all backlit keyboards I have tried so far and appears to me to be the limitations of the current materials available for molding the plastic keycaps in a light dispersing plastic. The optional ""breathing"" effect is nice but I will seldom use this feature. The ""sleep"" function I have not yet discovered how to initiate on my system. The accompanying ""User Manual"" is sparse on any instructions with the exception of a small list of key combinations for using the FN + Function keys, (F1-F12), to control the multimedia functions of most operating systems and how to control the led keyboard itself.The light function of this keyboard is ""onboard"" eliminating the necessity of any extra operating system driver or software support.The keys have a nice tactile feel to them and are positioned well for extended use without discomfort. The board itself, while lightweight, has a substantial feel which leads to an impression of quality surpassing other keyboards I have tried which cost much more.If you are looking for a well built but inexpensive backlit keyboard, I feel that this is a very safe investment for almost anyone.There is one more caveat, I am not a gamer so I can not attest to how well this keyboard would function as such. However, if you are firing off a quick email to your mother, or beginning the next great American novel ...",5,NA

In my opinion, it is more attractive and a better RGB experience than other more expensive keyboards.

That aspect was workable for me, though it might not be my favorite, but I can see where others would not like it that mushy.For me it has a tragic flaw that might not be a problem for others.  I'm a lefty and map the arrows and keys on the right side of the board for games for my right hand since I mouse left.  I also always map the num lock, which is in perfect index finger position.  This keyboard, unlike any keyboard I have ever used, does not register any keys if you have num lock pressed.  It seems to block other keypresses which messes up my gaming experience.  Again, dozens of keyboards over my lifetime, this is the first time I have ever experienced this.  My guess is they cut corners on the electronics to bring it in at this very cheap price.

But I love is a detachable cable so I could bought a different cable a coiled one and looks awesome. Great purchase. Another thing is that this one really has some additional keys to change those, unfortunately the additional keys do not have the transparent look that makes the key glow with the backlit. Awesome anyways,",5,NA

"107","Keyboard","Portable Mechanical Keyboard MageGee Backlit","Adam","Reviewed in the United States on October 14, 2022","I love this one, is tiny and portable","I purchased this for under $25, so I will review as such.  I got the yellow keycaps with blue switches.One of my hobbies is to buy dirt cheap mechanical keyboards and mod/improve them as much as I can.  Sometimes I fall in love with them, other times I just give away as custom made gifts.This caught my attention because it is pretty rare to see a removable USB C connection in the right spot on cheap mech keyboards, I've retrofitted one with a after market port and it was such a pain I said I would never bother again.For the price this is a pretty good keyboard, although one of the loudest I have, and I'm currently neck deep in about 15 different mech keyboards.  The switches are soldered on and are Jixian blues.  Reviews aren't great and I would agree. They feel fine but sound obnoxious.  I havn't tried the red switch option of this board but I would go that route if I ever repurchased, probably duller to the ear with similar feel when it comes to this grade switch.However, sound aside this is really nice to type on, and the cheapest 60% with USB C I have seen.  The keycaps it comes with are really nice doubleshots and it came with a bag of extras, even some that don't fit on this board, like number pad big 0 and long vertical enter.  Mine shipped all white and grey, and a bag of yellow modifiers/space/numkey/FN/backspace etc.  Also a red esc cap.I immediately took it apart by removing all keycaps and removing six screws.  Pretty solid board, but a big empty echo chamber of a base.  I added one layer of Zip-n-fit foam to the deep well towards the back, than another full panel layer to the remaining space.  I put 5 layers of masking tape on the back of the board and screwed it back together.This helped a long with the ""pinginess"" and reverb but the switches are still really load.  Replacing the switches will be my next project but a long on as there are 136 pins to solder.  Won't probably be worth it, but it's my wierd hobby and I will report back.My plans for this are my travel board for hotels.  I recently lost a very expensive keyboard in baggage check and would rather just have $25 loss over the aggravation and hassle over a $150 claim with the airlines.  If I was traveling with my wife though, she would tell me to throw this thing through the window because it is so loud.I guess if you are single, or plan to use it in a place with no one around, and budget is a concern and are willing to take it apart and make some adjustments, this is a very good $25 keyboard.  For anyone who has a great mechanical keyboard or are in earshot of 50ft of someone, this probably isn't for you.Edit: I bought another one with red switches.  I highly recommend going with red's, it feels better typing, and sounds 1000% better.",4,NA
"108","Keyboard","Portable Mechanical Keyboard MageGee Backlit","Adam","Reviewed in the United States on April 16, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","I recently purchased the MageGee Portable 60% Mechanical Gaming Keyboard, and overall, I'm quite satisfied with its performance.Firstly, the compact design of this keyboard is a significant selling point. The 60% form factor means it takes up minimal space on my desk, making it perfect for gaming setups with limited room or for on-the-go use. Despite its small size, the keys feel sturdy and responsive, providing a satisfying typing and gaming experience.The mechanical switches offer a nice tactile feedback, enhancing the overall typing experience. However, it's worth noting that the sound level might be a bit louder than some users prefer, especially in quieter environments.The LED backlighting is a nice touch, providing customizable lighting effects to match your gaming setup or personal preferences. The brightness levels are adjustable, allowing for comfortable use in various lighting conditions.In terms of compatibility, the MageGee Portable 60% Mechanical Gaming Keyboard works well with the Xbox Series X.Overall, the MageGee Portable 60% Mechanical Gaming Keyboard offers solid performance in a compact package. While it may not have all the bells and whistles of more expensive keyboards, it delivers a satisfying typing and gaming experience at a reasonable price point.",4,NA
"109","Keyboard","Portable Mechanical Keyboard MageGee Backlit","Misty Ingram","Reviewed in the United States on September 19, 2024","","I am a huge fan of this item. The switches are wonderful, and it's been my daily driver since my KeyChron got lost in a move almost a year and a half ago. I meant to replace it, but it has served my purposes so effectively that I haven't purchased a new one.That being said, I bought this in December of 2022, it is now September of 2024, and some of the individual backlights have begun to fail, specifically the V key and the comma key. With the caps that come with the keyboard, it is difficult to see what the key is without the backlight, so you may want to have different key caps in your amazon cart if you intend to use it long term!",5,NA
"110","Keyboard","Portable Mechanical Keyboard MageGee Backlit","Misty Ingram","Reviewed in the United States on October 13, 2024","Great keyboard for the price","This keyboard is nice and what I wanted, but the fn key doesn‚Äôt work for the functions f1-f12. It seems that the only programmed the fn key to toggle the light modes and forgot to actually link it to the function keys themselves. Doesn‚Äôt matter too much for me because I use a laptop and the keyboard works on that, meaning I can use the functions on there. If you are someone with a desktop, maybe look into another option. Those $100 mechanical keyboards are expensive but well worth it for the quality and overall look and experience for a full desktop setup. I‚Äôm actually buying one of those  expensive keyboards and giving this one to my girlfriend who also uses a keyboard with a laptop. She is excited for it, but you may not be if you are using a desktop and not a laptop. Those function keys not working will bother you at some point",5,NA

Glad I did.  I'm a 40 year IT pro, the keys ""feel"" strange and are flat, so fingers have a harder time finding the right key.  I'm used to feeling the depression of a key, so it takes some getting used to.  The key depress clicks and is satisfying, but just a little bit noisy (bad for recording studios, but fine for home or office use).  Light displays are nice - just wish it had a mode that moved with the music!  That would be cool.",4,NA
